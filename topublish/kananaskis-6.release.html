<h2 id="new-features">New features:</h2>

<ul>

<li><p>The <code>HolSmtLib</code> library now supports proof
    reconstruction for the
    <abbrev title="Satisfiability Modulo Theories">SMT</abbrev> solver
    <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/">Z3</a>.
    (Several other SMT solvers continue to be supported as
    oracles.)</p></li>

<li><p>The pretty-printer now uses colours to convey extra information
    about terms and types as they are printed.  For example, bound
    term variables are printed in green, and free variables are
    printed in blue.  This colouring will happen on colour terminals
    such as Unix <code>xterm</code> (also the standard MacOS Terminal
    application), as well as inside Emacs.</p>

   <p> If you are using the
    Emacs mode, then the types of both sorts of variables are also
    available in a mouse-over tooltip.  Moreover, the colours and
    printing-styles used in the Emacs mode for things like bound
    variables can be customised,
    using <code>M-x&nbsp;customize</code>. </p>

    <p>Besides this automatic colored pretty-printing depending on
    the term structure, it is now possible to define syntax highlighting
    in userprinters.</p></li>

<li><p>Many type variables can now be parsed and printed as lower-case
    Greek letters.  For example, you can input <code>``:'a``</code>,
    and will get back <code>``:α``</code>.  You can also input type
    variables using the Greek letters (except for the letter λ).
    Underneath, the type variable still has the name with the
    apostrophe: this is a purely presentational change.</p></li>

<li><p>Bounded rewrites work better (a few bugs were fixed here), and
there is now also an easy way to specify that a rewrite should only
occur on the left or right side of a term.  For example, to apply the
theorem <code>th</code> twice, and on the left-hand side on an equality,
use</p>
<pre>
         SIMP_TAC bool_ss [Ntimes th 2, SimpLHS]
</pre>
<p>To rewrite on the right-hand side:</p>
<pre>
         SIMP_TAC bool_ss [Ntimes th 2, SimpRHS]
</pre>
<p>It is also possible to rewrite on the left or right sides of
operators other than equality.  See the Description manual for
details. </p>
</li>

<li><p>If the block of universally quantified variables at the head of
a clause in the definition of an inductive relation contains duplicate
names, <code>Hol_reln</code> detects this and provides an informative
error message. </p></li>

<li><p>There are two new “document-level” modes for using HOL’s
LaTeX-pretty-printing technology (originally due to Ramana Kumar and
Thomas Türk).  In both, terms, types and theorems become
straightforward to embed in LaTeX documents.  For example, one might
write something like</p>
<pre>
        The term \HOLtm{p1 /\ q2} is a typical conjunction.
</pre>
<p> and have this turned into </p>
<pre>
        The term <i>p₁</i> ∧ <i>q₂</i> is a typical conjunction.
</pre>
<p> after LaTeX has been run.  The ASCII conjunction has turned into a
nice LaTeX maths symbol, and the term has been parsed, allowing
variables to be printed in italic font, and with trailing digits
sub-scripted. </p>

<p>See the Description manual for more detailed documentation.

</li>

<li> <p> Simplification of terms involving the <code>EL</code> operator
(calculates the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> element of a list) is better.

<li><p> Some new syntax for various bag operations, including arithmetic
symbols <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>≤</code>
for the notions on bags that are just point-wise lifts of those
operators on numbers
(<code>BAG_UNION</code>, <code>BAG_DIFF</code>, <code>PSUB_BAG</code>, <code>SUB_BAG</code>).</li>

<li><p> New syntax for universal sets
(in <code>pred_setTheory</code>).  In ASCII
mode, <code>univ(:'a)</code> is the universal set with elements drawn
from type <code>:'a</code>.  Another example: <code>univ(:num)</code>
is the set of all natural numbers. With Unicode on, the first example
prints as <code>&#120140;(:α)</code>.  The Unicode character used here
(U+1D54C, a cute uppercase ‘U’) is beyond the BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane)
and may not appear in many fonts.  Rather than have to give up all of
Unicode to get around this, there is an additional trace variable
(<code>"Unicode Univ printing"</code>) to turn off the use of this
character, making the syntax use <code>univ</code> once more.

<p>Of course, the old syntax (<code>UNIV:'a&nbsp;->&nbsp;bool</code>,
or <code>UNIV:'a&nbsp;set</code>) continues to work.

<li><p> A new “vim mode” for controlling a HOL session from within the
vim editor. This mimicks most of the important features of the Emacs
mode.  See <code>tools/vim</code> for a README file about this
feature. Thanks to Ramana Kumar for the implementation of this tool.

<li> <p> If syntax that involves non-ASCII characters is added
using <code>add_rule</code>, <code>set_fixity</code>
or <code>overload_on</code>, it is only used if the Unicode flag is
set.  If the Unicode flag is toggled off and then on again, the
Unicode syntax will disappear and reappear appropriately.


<li> <p> The persistent simpset (<code>srw_ss()</code>, also used
in <code>SRW_TAC</code>) can now have named simpset fragments removed from
it using the function <code>diminish_srw_ss</code>.

<li> <p> <code>bin/build</code> uses earlier (cached) options when not
explicitly overridden.

In particular, kernel specifications (<code>-expk</code>, and the new <code>-stdknl</code>), and
build-sequence file specifications are cached in
<code>tools/lastbuildoptions</code> so that one can subsequently do
just <code>bin/build</code> to build again with those same options.
To override a <code>-seq foo</code> option, you can use
the <code>-fullbuild</code> option.

<p> Other options (<code>-symlink</code>, <code>-selftest</code>) are
not cached.

<li> <p>Users can configure their interactive sessions (setting output
pretty-printing options with <code>set_trace</code> commands for
example), by writing SML code into a <code>.hol-config.sml</code> file
in their HOME directory.  In fact, all of the following are acceptable
names for the file: <code>hol-config.sml</code>, <code>hol-config.ML</code>, <code>.hol-config</code>, <code>.hol-config.sml</code>,
and <code>.hol-config.ML</code>.  The first of these that is found is
used.

<p> (The meaning of “the user’s home
directory” is clear on Unix systems.  On Windows, the environment
variables <code>HOMEPATH</code> and <code>APPDATA</code> are consulted
to determine where to look.)

<p> The file, if it exists, is <code>use</code>-d into the interactive
session, when it begins.  A message is printed saying as much also.
</ul>

<h2 id="bugs-fixed">Bugs fixed:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Type abbreviations used to be able to be applied to more type
arguments than they were expecting.  E.g.,</p>
<pre>
         type_abbrev("foo", ``:bool``)
</pre>
<p>followed by</p>
<pre>
         ``:'a foo``
</pre>
<p>used to work.  No more!</p>
</li>

<li><p> <code>Hol_reln</code> now correctly accepts inductive
definitions where type variables appear only in schematic
variables.</p></li>

<li><p><code>Hol_reln</code> now correctly accepts inductive
definitions defining multiple (presumably multiply recursive)
relations with schematic variables.  Note that for a variable to be
detected as schematic in this situation, it needs to be a parameter to
all relations, even if it may not be used in all of them.

<li><p>The syntax <code>num$0</code> failed to parse.  Thanks to
Behzad Akbarpour for the report of this bug.</p></li>

<li><p>In <code>Hol_datatype</code>, nested recursion in record data
types where the new type was also polymorphic failed.  Thanks to Ramana
Kumar for the report of this bug. </p>

<li><p>In <code>Hol_datatype</code>, nested recursion involving
the <code>itself</code> type constructor could fail.  Thanks to Ramana
Kumar for the report of and fix for this bug. </p>

<li><p>The <code>TypeNet</code> data structure for indexing
information by types could get confused if the “same” type was
redefined (in the one interactive session) with different arities.
Thanks to Ramana Kumar for the bug report that led to the isolation of
this problem.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="new-theories">New theories:</h2>

<ul>
<li> <p> A very simple theory <code>string_numTheory</code> demonstrating
that strings and natural numbers are in bijection (with
functions <code>n2s</code> and <code>s2n</code> constructively
demonstrating this bijection).

<li> <p>A theory of trie-like trees that recurse under a finite
map, <code>fmaptreeTheory</code>.  This type can be used to represent
recursive namespace-like environments.
</ul>

<h2 id="new-tools">New tools:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p> A new library <code>HolQbfLib</code> provides an interface to
external Quantified Boolean Formulae (QBF) solvers.  It can check
certificates of invalidity generated by the QBF solver Squolem.</li>

<li><p>A bit-blasting conversion for operations on fixed-width
words: <code>BBLAST_CONV</code>.  This goes beyond the capabilities
of <code>WORD_BIT_EQ_CONV</code> by expanding out additions and
subtractions.  This allows the new conversion to automatically handle
small but tricky bit vector goals.  For example:
<pre>
         (x && 3w = 0w:word32) ==&gt; ((x + 4w * y) && 3w = 0w)
</pre>
<p> and
<pre>
         !a:word8. a &lt;+ 4w /\ b &lt;+ a /\ c &lt;=+ 5w ==&gt; (b + c) &lt;=+ 7w
</pre>
<p>
(These aren’t provable with <code>wordsLib.WORD_DECIDE</code>.)

<p> Obviously bit-blasting is a brute force approach, so the new
conversion should be used with care.  It will only work well for
smallish word sizes and when there is only and handful of additions
around.  It is also “eager”—additions are expanded out even when
not strictly necessary.  For example, in
<pre>
         (a + b) &lt;+ c /\ c &lt;+ d ==&gt; (a + b) &lt;+ d:word32
</pre>
<p>
the sum <code>a + b</code> is expanded.  Users may be able to achieve
speed-ups by first introducing abbreviations and then proving general
forms, <i>e.g.</i>
<pre>
         x &lt;+ c /\ c &lt;+ d ==&gt; x &lt;+ d:word32
</pre>
<p> The conversion handles most operators, however, the following are
not covered or interpreted:
<ul>
 <li> Type variables for word lengths, <i>i.e.</i> terms of type <code>``:'a word``</code>

 <li> General multiplication, i.e. <code>``w1 * w2``</code>.
   Multiplication by a literal is
   okay, although this may introduce many additions.

 <li> Bit field selections with non-literal bounds, e.g. <code>``(exp1 -- exp2) w``</code>.

 <li> Shifting by non-literal amounts, <i>e.g.</i> <code>``w &lt;&lt; exp``</code>.

 <li> <code>``n2w exp``</code> and <code>``w2n w``</code>.  Also <code>w2s</code>, <code>s2w</code>, <code>w2l</code> and <code>l2w</code>.

  <li> <code>word_div</code>, <code>word_sdiv</code>, <code>word_mod</code>
  and <code>word_log2</code>.

</ul>




</ul>

<h2 id="new-versions">New versions:</h2>

<h2 id="new-examples">New examples:</h2>

<ul>
<li> A development of some basic computability theory:
<ul>
  <li> a development of λ-terms as computable functions, showing that
  things like Church-numerals are as powerful as one would like, and
  that λ-terms can indeed be set up to evaluate suitably encoded
  λ-terms (thereby providing a Universal Machine);

  <li> a development of primitive recursive and recursive
  functions doing much the same;

  <li> a demonstration that both models can emulate each other;

  <li> definition of concepts of recursive, and
  recursively-enumerable sets; and

  <li> some standard results, including: the Halting Problem, Rice's
  Theorem, the Recursion theorem, that recursive sets are closed under
  union and complementation, that r.e. sets are closed under union and
  intersection but not complement, and that if a set and its
  complement are both r.e. then they are both recursive.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="incompatibilities">Incompatibilities:</h2>

<ul>

<li><p><code>Drule.CONJUNCTS_CONV</code> (proving equivalence of
  conjunctions under associativity, commutativity and idempotence) has
  been renamed to <code>Drule.CONJUNCTS_AC</code>.</p></li>

<li><p><code>Drule.CONJ_SET_CONV</code>
  and <code>Drule.FRONT_CONJ_CONV</code> have been removed. Their
  functionality can easily be derived
  from <code>Drule.CONJUNCTS_AC</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>The overload <code>&lt;&gt;</code> on <code>words$word_slice</code>
  has been removed and replaced with <code>''</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>The interface of <code>userprinter</code> (user defined pretty
  printers) changed.  Instead of getting just two
  functions <code>add_string</code> and <code>add_break</code>, it now
  gets a record of type <code>term_pp_types.ppstream_funs</code> that
  contains these functions as well as several others.</p></li>

<li><p>The type of the <code>filter</code> field of
the <code>SSFRAG</code> function for constructing simpset fragment
values has changed
from <code>(thm&nbsp;->&nbsp;thm&nbsp;list)&nbsp;option</code>
to <code>(controlled_thm&nbsp;->&nbsp;controlled_thm&nbsp;list)&nbsp;option</code>,
where a <q>controlled theorem</q> value is a pair of a theorem and a
control indicating how many times the rewrite is allowed to be
applied.  See the REFERENCE and the <code>BoundedRewrites</code>
module for details.</p>

<li><p>The <code>Unicode</code> structure is now a sub-structure
of <code>Parse</code>, due to some significant code-reorganisation.
This means that a line such as
<pre>
         open Parse boolLib Unicode
</pre>
<p>will fail.  Instead it must be
<pre>
         open Parse boolLib
         open Unicode
</pre>

<li><p>The constant <code>INFINITE</code>
in <code>pred_setTheory</code> has been replaced by an abbreviation.
Thus, if one types <code>``INFINITE&nbsp;s``</code>, the underlying term is
really <code>¬FINITE&nbsp;s</code>.  All instances of this pattern
will print as <code>INFINITE&nbsp;s</code>.  The
functions <code>mk_infinite</code>, <code>dest_infinite</code>
and <code>is_infinite</code> in <code>pred_setSyntax</code> continue
to work and do the “right thing”, the
entrypoint <code>infinite_tm</code> in the same module has been removed.</p>
