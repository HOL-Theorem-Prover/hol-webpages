----------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT_EQ : (term -> thm -> thm)

SYNOPSIS
Applies epsilon abstraction to both terms of an equation.

KEYWORDS
rule, epsilon, equality.

DESCRIBE
Effects the extensionality of the epsilon operator {@}.

       A |- t1 = t2
   ------------------------  SELECT_EQ "x"      [where x is not free in A]
    A |- (@x.t1) = (@x.t2)




FAILURE
Fails if the conclusion of the theorem is not an equation, or if the
variable {x} is free in {A}.

EXAMPLE
Given a theorem which shows the equivalence of two distinct forms of
defining the property of being an even number:

   th = |- (x MOD 2 = 0) = (?y. x = 2 * y)

A theorem giving the equivalence of the epsilon abstraction of each
form is obtained:

   - SELECT_EQ (Term `x:num`) th;
   > val it = |- (@x. x MOD 2 = 0) = (@x. ?y. x = 2 * y) : thm
