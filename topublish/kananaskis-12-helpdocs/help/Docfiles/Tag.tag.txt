type tag

SYNOPSIS
Abstract type of oracle tags.

KEYWORDS
tag, oracle.

DESCRIBE
The type {tag} is used to track the use of oracles in HOL. An ‘oracle’
is a source of theorems that are not proved, but just asserted. In HOL,
such unproven ‘theorems’ are used to incorporate the results of
external proof tools. Each theorem coming from an oracle has a tag
attached to it. This tag gets copied to any theorems hereditarily
generated from an oracular theorem by inference.

SEEALSO
Tag.read, Thm.mk_oracle_thm.
