----------------------------------------------------------------------
TACS_TO_LT : tactic list -> list_tactic

SYNOPSIS
The list-tactic which applies a list of tactics to the
corresponding members of a list of goals.

KEYWORDS
tactical.

DESCRIBE
If {T1,...,Tn} are tactics, {TACS_TO_LT [T1,...,Tn]} is a
list-tactic which applies the tactics {T1,...,Tn} to the
corresponding goals.

FAILURE
The application of {TACS_TO_LT} to a tactic list never fails.
The resulting list-tactic fails if length of the goal list
is not the same as that of the tactic list,
or finally if {Ti} fails when applied to the {i}â€™th member of the goal list.

USES
Applying different tactics to different subgoals.

EXAMPLE
Where {tac1} is a tactic and {tacs2} is a list of tactics,
{tac1 THEN_LT TACS_TO_LT tacs2} is equivalent to {tac1 THENL tacs2}

SEEALSO
Tactical.THEN_LT, Tactical.THENL.
