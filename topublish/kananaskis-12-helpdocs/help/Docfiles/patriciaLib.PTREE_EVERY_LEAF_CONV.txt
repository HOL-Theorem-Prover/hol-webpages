PTREE_EVERY_LEAF_CONV : conv

SYNOPSIS
Conversion for evaluating applications of {patricia$EVERY_LEAF}.

DESCRIBE
The conversion {PTREE_EVERY_LEAF_CONV} evaluates terms of the form {EVERY_LEAF P t} where {t} is a well-formed Patricia tree (constructed by {patricia$Empty}, {patricia$Leaf} and {patricia$Branch}) and {P} is predicate.

FAILURE
The conversion will fail if the supplied term is not a suitable application of {patricia$EVERY_LEAF}.

EXAMPLE

- patriciaLib.PTREE_EVERY_LEAF_CONV ``EVERY_LEAF (=) Empty``;
> val it = |- EVERY_LEAF $= <{}> <=> T: thm

- patriciaLib.PTREE_EVERY_LEAF_CONV ``EVERY_LEAF (\x y. (x < 3) ==> (y = 1)) (Branch 0 0 (Leaf 3 2) (Leaf 2 1))``;
> val it =
   |- EVERY_LEAF (\x y. x < 3 ==> (y = 1))
        (Branch 0 0 (Leaf 3 2) (Leaf 2 1)) <=> T:
   thm

- patriciaLib.PTREE_EVERY_LEAF_CONV ``EVERY_LEAF (\x y. x < 2) (Branch 0 0 (Leaf 3 2) (Leaf 2 1))``;
> val it =
   |- EVERY_LEAF (\x y. x < 2) (Branch 0 0 (Leaf 3 2) (Leaf 2 1)) <=> F:
   thm
