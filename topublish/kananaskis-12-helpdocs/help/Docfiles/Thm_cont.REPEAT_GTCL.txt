REPEAT_GTCL : (thm_tactical -> thm_tactical)

SYNOPSIS
Applies a theorem-tactical until it fails when applied to a goal.

KEYWORDS
theorem-tactical.

DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem-tactical, a theorem-tactic, a theorem and a goal:

   REPEAT_GTCL ttl ttac th goal

{REPEAT_GTCL} repeatedly modifies the theorem according to
{ttl} till the result of handing it to {ttac} and applying it to the goal
fails (this may be no times at all).

FAILURE
Fails iff the theorem-tactic fails immediately when applied to the theorem
and the goal.

EXAMPLE
The following tactic matches {th}â€™s antecedents against the assumptions
of the goal until it can do so no longer, then puts the resolvents
onto the assumption list:

   REPEAT_GTCL (IMP_RES_THEN ASSUME_TAC) th




SEEALSO
Thm_cont.REPEAT_TCL, Thm_cont.THEN_TCL.
