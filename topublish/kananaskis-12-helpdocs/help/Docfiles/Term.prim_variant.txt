----------------------------------------------------------------------
prim_variant : term list -> term -> term

SYNOPSIS
Rename a variable to be different from any in a list.

KEYWORDS
variable, renaming.

DESCRIBE
The function {prim_variant} is exactly the same as {variant}, except that
it doesnâ€™t rename away from constants.

FAILURE
{prim_variant l t} fails if any term in the list {l} is not a variable
or if {t} is not a variable.

EXAMPLE

- variant [] (mk_var("T",bool));
> val it = `T'` : term

- prim_variant [] (mk_var("T",bool));
> val it = `T` : term




COMMENTS
The extra amount of renaming that {variant} does is useful when generating
new constant names (even though it returns a variable) inside high-level
definition mechanisms. Otherwise, {prim_variant} seems preferable.

SEEALSO
Term.variant, Term.mk_var, Term.genvar, Term.mk_primed_var.
