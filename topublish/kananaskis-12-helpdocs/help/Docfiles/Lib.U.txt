U : ''a list list -> ''a list

SYNOPSIS
Takes the union of a list of sets.

KEYWORDS
list, set, eqtype.

DESCRIBE
An application {U [l1, ..., ln]} is equivalent to
{union l1 (... (union ln-1, ln)...)}. Thus, every element that
occurs in one of the lists will appear in the result.

FAILURE
Never fails.

EXAMPLE

- U [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [1,2,5]];
> val it = [3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5] : int list




COMMENTS
The order in which the elements occur in the resulting list should
not be depended upon.

A high-performance implementation of finite sets may be found in
structure {HOLset}.

ML equality types are used in the implementation of {U} and its kin.
This limits its applicability to types that allow equality. For other
types, typically abstract ones, use the ‘op_’ variants.
