AP_THM                                                           (Thm)

AP_THM : thm -> term -> thm

SYNOPSIS
Proves equality of equal functions applied to a term.

KEYWORDS
rule.

DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- f = g} and a term {x}, the inference
rule {AP_THM} returns the theorem {A |- f x = g x}.

      A |- f = g
   ----------------  AP_THM (A |- f = g) x
    A |- f x = g x




FAILURE
Fails unless the conclusion of the theorem is an equation, both sides
of which are functions whose domain type is the same as that of the
supplied term.
