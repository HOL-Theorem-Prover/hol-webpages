completeInduct_on : term quotation -> tactic

SYNOPSIS
Perform complete induction.

KEYWORDS
induction, complete.

DESCRIBE
If {q} parses into a well-typed term {M}, an invocation
{completeInduct_on q} begins a proof by complete (also known as
‘course-of-values’) induction on {M}. The term {M} should occur free in
the current goal.

FAILURE
If {M} does not parse into a term or does not occur free in the
current goal.

EXAMPLE
Suppose we wish to prove that every number not equal to one has a prime
factor:

   !n. ~(n = 1) ==> ?p. prime p /\ p divides n

A natural way to prove this is by complete induction. Invoking
{completeInduct_on `n`} yields the goal

      { !m. m < n ==> ~(m = 1) ==> ?p. prime p /\ p divides m }
      ?-
      ~(n = 1) ==> ?p. prime p /\ p divides n
