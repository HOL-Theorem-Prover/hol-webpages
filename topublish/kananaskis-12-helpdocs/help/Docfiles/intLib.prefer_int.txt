----------------------------------------------------------------------
intLib.prefer_int : unit -> unit

SYNOPSIS
Makes the parser favour integer possibilities in ambiguous terms.

KEYWORDS
parsing

DESCRIBE
Calling {prefer_int()} causes the global grammar to be altered so that
the standard arithmetic operator symbols ({+}, {*}, etc.), as well as
numerals, are given integral types if possible.  This effect is
brought about through the application of multiple calls to
{temp_overload_on}, so that the “arithmetic symbols” need not have
been previously mapping to integral possibilities at all (as would be
the situation after a call to {deprecate_int}).

FAILURE
Never fails.

SEEALSO
intLib.deprecate_int, Parse.overload_on.
