----------------------------------------------------------------------
overload_info_for: string -> unit

SYNOPSIS
Prints overload information for a string.

KEYWORDS
Parsing, pretty-printing.

DESCRIBE
A call to {overload_info_for s} will cause the system to print (to
standard out) some information about the way in which the string {s}
may be overloaded in the current global grammar. The system will print
first the terms that {s} may parse to, and then the terms that might
prompt the printing of {s}. Typically, both sets of terms will be the
same, but they donâ€™t have to be.

FAILURE
Never fails.

EXAMPLE

> overload_info_for "<=>";
<=> parses to:
  ($= :bool -> bool -> bool)
<=> might be printed from:
  ($= :bool -> bool -> bool)
val it = (): unit


COMMENTS
Pretty-printed grammar values (such as returned by {term_grammar()})
include some of this information for all the constants that the
grammar parses.

SEEALSO
Parse.overload_on, Parse.term_grammar.
