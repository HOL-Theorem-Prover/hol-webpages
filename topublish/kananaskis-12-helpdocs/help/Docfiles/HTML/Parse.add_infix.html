<SPAN class = "TEXT">
where </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&lt;str1&gt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&lt;str2&gt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> have been parsed to two terms
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&lt;t1&gt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&lt;t2&gt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  The parsing process does not pay any attention to
whether or not </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> corresponds to a constant or not.  This resolution
happens later in the parse, and will result in either a constant or a
variable with name </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  In fact, if this name is overloaded, the
eventual term generated may have a constant of quite a different name
again; the resolution of overloading comes as a separate phase (see
the entry for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">overload_on</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">).</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_infix</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails if the precedence level chosen for the new infix is
the same as a different type of grammar rule (e.g., suffix or binder),
or if the specified precedence level has infixes already but of a
different associativity.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">It is also possible that the choice of string </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will result in an
ambiguous grammar.  This will be marked with a warning.  The parser
may behave in strange ways if it encounters ambiguous phrases, but
will work normally otherwise.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Though we may not have </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">+</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> defined as a constant, we can still define
it as an infix for the purposes of printing and parsing:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - add_infix ("+", 500, HOLgrammars.LEFT);
   &gt; val it = () : unit

   - val t = Term`x + y`;
   &lt;&lt;HOL message: inventing new type variable names: 'a, 'b, 'c.&gt;&gt;
   &gt; val t = `x + y` : term
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
We can confirm that this new infix has indeed been parsed
that way by taking the resulting term apart:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - dest_comb t;
   &gt; val it = (`$+ x`, `y`) : term * term
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
With its new status, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">+</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> has to be &ldquo;quoted&rdquo; with a
dollar-sign if we wish to use it in a position where it is not an
infix, as in the binding list of an abstraction:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - Term`\$+. x + y`;
   &lt;&lt;HOL message: inventing new type variable names: 'a, 'b, 'c.&gt;&gt;
   &gt; val it = `\$+. x + y` : term
   - dest_abs it;
   &gt; val it = (`$+`,`x + y`) : term * term
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The generation of three new type variables in the examples
above emphasises the fact that the terms in the first example and the
body of the second are really no different from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f&nbsp;x&nbsp;y</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (where </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is
a variable), and don&rsquo;t have anything to do with the constant for
addition from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">arithmeticTheory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  The new </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">+</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> infix is left
associative:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - Term`x + y + z`;
   &lt;&lt;HOL message: inventing new type variable names: 'a, 'b.&gt;&gt;
   &gt; val it = `x + y + z` : term

   - dest_comb it;
   &gt; val it = (`$+ (x + y)`, `z`) : term * term
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
It is also more tightly binding than </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">/\</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (which has
precedence 400 by default):
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - Term`p /\ q + r`;
   &lt;&lt;HOL message: inventing new type variable names: 'a, 'b.&gt;&gt;
   &gt; val it = `p /\ q + r` : term

   - dest_comb it;
   &gt; val it = (`$/\ p`, `q + r`) : term * term
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
An attempt to define a right associative operator at the
same level fails:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   Lib.try add_infix("-", 500, HOLgrammars.RIGHT);

   Exception raised at Parse.add_infix:
   Grammar Error: Attempt to have differently associated infixes
                  (RIGHT and LEFT) at same level
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Similarly we can&rsquo;t define an infix at level 900, because
this is where the (true prefix) rule for logical negation (</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">~</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) is.
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - Lib.try add_infix("-", 900, HOLgrammars.RIGHT);

   Exception raised at Parse.add_infix:
   Grammar Error: Attempt to have different forms at same level
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Finally, an attempt to have a second </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">+</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> infix at a different
precedence level causes grief when we later attempt to use the parser:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - add_infix("+", 400, HOLgrammars.RIGHT);
   &gt; val it = () : unit

   - Term`p + q`;
   &lt;&lt;HOL warning: Parse.Term: Grammar ambiguous on token pair + and +,
                  and probably others too&gt;&gt;
   &lt;&lt;HOL message: inventing new type variable names: 'a, 'b, 'c&gt;&gt;
   &gt; val it = ``p + q`` : term
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
In this situation, the behaviour of the parser will become quite
unpredictable whenever the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">+</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> token is encountered.  In particular,
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">+</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> may parse with either fixity.</SPAN>

<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">USES</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Most use of infixes will want to have them associated with a
particular constant in which case the definitional principles
(</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_infixl_definition</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> etc) are more likely to be appropriate.
However, a development of a theory of abstract algebra may well want
to have infix variables such as </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">+</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> above.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
