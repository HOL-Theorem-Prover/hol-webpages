<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">When applied to the goal </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(asl,w)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the tactic
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q.MATCH_ASMSUB_RENAME_TAC&nbsp;q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> parses the quotation </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the context
of the goal, producing a term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pat</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to use as a pattern. The tactic
then attempts a (first order) match of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pat</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> against each term in
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">asl</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, stopping when it finds an assumption that either matches </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pat</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
in its entirety, or has a sub-term that matches </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pat</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (holding
existing free variables from the goal constant).</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">In either case, the match will return an instantiation mapping the
fresh free variables of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pat</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to terms occurring in the goal. This
instantiation drops its bindings for variables whose names begin with
an underscore, is next reversed, and is finally applied to the goal.
This will both cause free variables in the goal to be renamed, and for
larger terms to be replaced by variables (similar to what happens with
the use of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">SPEC_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">).</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Fails if there is no valid match for the pattern among the assumptions
and their sub-terms. A valid match will not bind variables that are
bound in the assumption being searched.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">In the following example, the variable </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is treated as if a
constant, so the search for a match with the pattern does not succeed
on the first assumption (featuring </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">P</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">). Instead the second assumption
provides the instantiation, and so the variable </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">z</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the original is
renamed to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.
