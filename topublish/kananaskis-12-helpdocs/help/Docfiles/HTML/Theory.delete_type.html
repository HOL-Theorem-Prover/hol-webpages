<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">An invocation </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">delete_type&nbsp;s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> removes the type constant denoted by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
from the current HOL segment. All types, terms, and theorems that
depend on that type should therefore disappear, as though they hadn&rsquo;t been
constructed in the first place. Conceptually, they have become "garbage"
and need to be collected. However, because of the way that HOL is
implemented in ML, it is not possible to have them automatically collected.
Instead, HOL tracks the currency of type and term constants and provides
some consistency maintenance support.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">In particular, the implementation ensures that a deleted type
operator is never equal to a subsequently declared type operator
with the same name (and arity). Furthermore, although garbage types,
terms, and theorems may exist in a session, no theorem, definition,
or axiom that is garbage is exported when </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">export_theory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is invoked.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The notion of garbage is hereditary. Any type, term, definition, or theorem
is garbage if any of its constituents are. Furthermore, if a type operator or
term constant had been defined, and its witness theorem later becomes
garbage, then that type or term is garbage, as is anything built from it.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
