<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RW_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a simplification tactic that provides conditional and
contextual rewriting, and automatic invocation of conversions and decision
procedures in the course of simplification. An application </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RW_TAC&nbsp;ss&nbsp;thl</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
adds the theorems in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thl</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to the simpset </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ss</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and proceeds to simplify the
goal.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The process is based upon the simplification procedures in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">simpLib</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">,
but is more persistent in attempting to apply rewrite rules. It
automatically incorporates relevant results from datatype declarations
(the most important of these are injectivity and distinctness of
constructors). It uses the current hypotheses when rewriting the
goal. It automatically performs case-splitting on conditional
expressions in the goal. It simplifies any equation between constructors
occurring in the goal or the hypotheses. It automatically substitutes
through the goal any assumption that is an equality </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v&nbsp;=&nbsp;M</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> or </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">M&nbsp;=&nbsp;v</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">,
if </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a variable not occurring in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">M</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  It eliminates any boolean
variable or negated boolean variable occurring as a hypothesis. It
breaks down any conjunctions, disjunctions, double negations, or
existentials occurring as hypotheses. It keeps the goal in "stripped"
format so that the resulting goal will not be an implication or
universally quantified.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
