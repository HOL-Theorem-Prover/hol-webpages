<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Rewrites a term, selecting terms according to a user-specified strategy.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Rewriting in HOL is based on the use of equational theorems as left-to-right
replacements on the subterms of an object theorem.  This replacement is
mediated by the use of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, which finds matches between left-hand
sides of given equations in a term and applies the substitution.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Equations used in rewriting are obtained from the theorem lists given as
arguments to the function. These are at first transformed into a form suitable
for rewriting. Conjunctions are separated into individual rewrites. Theorems
with conclusions of the form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">"~t"</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are transformed into the corresponding
equations </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">"t&nbsp;=&nbsp;F"</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. Theorems </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">"t"</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> which are not equations are cast as
equations of form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">"t&nbsp;=&nbsp;T"</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If a theorem is used to rewrite a term, its assumptions
are added to the assumptions of the returned theorem.
The matching involved uses variable instantiation.
Thus, all free variables are generalized, and
terms are instantiated before substitution.
Theorems may have universally quantified variables.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The theorems with which rewriting is done are divided
into two groups, to facilitate implementing other rewriting tools.
However, they are considered in an order-independent fashion. (That
is, the ordering is an implementation detail which is not specified.)</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The search strategy for finding matching subterms is the first
argument to the rule. Matching and substitution may occur at any
level of the term, according to the specified search strategy: the
whole term, or starting from any subterm. The search strategy also
specifies the depth of the search: recursively up to an arbitrary
depth until no matches occur, once over the selected subterm, or any
more complex scheme.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">GEN_REWRITE_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails if the search strategy fails. It may also
cause a non-terminating sequence of rewrites, depending on the search
strategy used.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">USES</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">This conversion is used in the system to implement all other rewritings
conversions, and may provide a user with a method to fine-tune rewriting of
terms.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Suppose we have a term of the form:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   "(1 + 2) + 3 = (3 + 1) + 2"
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
and we would like to rewrite the left-hand side with the
theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ADD_SYM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> without changing the right hand side. This can be
done by using:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   GEN_REWRITE_CONV (RATOR_CONV o ONCE_DEPTH_CONV) empty_rewrites [ADD_SYM] mythm
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Other rules, such as </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ONCE_REWRITE_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, would match and
substitute on both sides, which would not be the desirable result.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">As another example, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWRITE_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> could be implemented as
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
    GEN_REWRITE_CONV TOP_DEPTH_CONV (implicit_rewrites())
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
which specifies that matches should be searched recursively
starting from the whole term of the theorem, and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">implicit_rewrites</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> must
be added to the user defined set of theorems employed in rewriting.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
