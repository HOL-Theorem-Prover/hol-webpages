<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">drule</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> tactic is similar to, but a great deal more controlled
than, the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">IMP_RES_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> tactic, which will look for a great many more
possible instantiations and resolutions to perform. </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">IMP_RES_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> also
puts all of its derived consequences into the assumption list; </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">drule</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
can be sure that there will be just one such consequence, and puts
this into the goal directly.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The related </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">dxrule</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> tactic removes the matching assumption from the
assumption list. In this example above, the resulting assumption list
would just contain </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">1&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;x</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, having lost the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">0&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;y</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> which was
resolved against the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">DIV_LESS</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> theorem.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">drule</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> tactic uses the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">MP_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thm_tactic</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> as its fixed
continuation; the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">drule_then</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> variation takes a </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thm_tactic</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
continuation as its first parameter and applies this to the result of
the instantiation and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">MP</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> call. There is also a </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">dxrule_then</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, that
combines both variations described here.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Finally, note that the implicational theorem may itself have come from
the goal&rsquo;s assumptions, extracted with tools such as </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">FIRST_ASSUM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">PAT_ASSUM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
