<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is one of the basic building blocks for the implementation of
rewriting in the HOL system. In particular, the term replacement or rewriting
done by all the built-in rewriting rules and tactics is ultimately done by
applications of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to appropriate subterms.  The description given
here for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> may therefore be taken as a specification of the atomic
action of replacing equals by equals that is used in all these higher level
rewriting tools.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The first argument to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is expected to be an equational theorem
which is to be used as a left-to-right rewrite rule.  The general form of this
theorem is:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   A |- t[x1,...,xn] = u[x1,...,xn]
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
where </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">xn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are all the variables that occur free in the
left-hand side of the conclusion of the theorem but do not occur free in the
assumptions. Any of these variables may also be universally quantified at the
outermost level of the equation, as for example in:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   A |- !x1...xn. t[x1,...,xn] = u[x1,...,xn]
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Note that </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will also work, but will give a generally
undesirable result (see below), if the right-hand side of the equation contains
free variables that do not also occur free on the left-hand side, as for
example in:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   A |- t[x1,...,xn] = u[x1,...,xn,y1,...,ym]
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
where the variables </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">y1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ym</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> do not occur free in
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t[x1,...,xn]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is an equational theorem of the kind shown above, then
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWR_CONV&nbsp;th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> returns a conversion that maps terms of the form
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t[e1,...,en/x1,...,xn]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, in which the terms </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">e1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">en</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are free for
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">xn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, to theorems of the form:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   A |- t[e1,...,en/x1,...,xn] = u[e1,...,en/x1,...,xn]
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
That is, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWR_CONV&nbsp;th&nbsp;tm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> attempts to match the left-hand side of
the rewrite rule </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to the term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  If such a match is possible, then
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> returns the corresponding substitution instance of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is given a theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">:

inconvenient for other purposes.  This situation is, however, relatively rare;
in most equations the free variables on the right-hand side are a subset of the
free variables on the left-hand side.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">In addition to doing substitution for free variables in the supplied equational

<SPAN class = "TEXT">As noted, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWR_CONV&nbsp;th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will fail rather than substitute for variables or type

<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The following example illustrates a straightforward use of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.
The supplied rewrite rule is polymorphic, and both substitution for free
variables and type instantiation may take place.  </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">EQ_SYM_EQ</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is the theorem:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   |- !x:'a. !y. (x = y) = (y = x)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWR_CONV&nbsp;EQ_SYM_EQ</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> behaves as follows:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - REWR_CONV EQ_SYM_EQ (Term `1 = 2`);
   &gt; val it = |- (1 = 2) = (2 = 1) : thm

   - REWR_CONV EQ_SYM_EQ (Term `1 &lt; 2`);
   ! Uncaught exception:
   ! HOL_ERR
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The second application fails because the left-hand side </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;y</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> of
the rewrite rule does not match the term to be rewritten, namely </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">1&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">In the following example, one might expect the result to be the theorem
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A&nbsp;|-&nbsp;f&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, where </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is the assumption of the supplied rewrite rule:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - REWR_CONV (ASSUME (Term `!x:'a. f x = x`)) (Term `f 2:num`);
   ! Uncaught exception:
   ! HOL_ERR
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The application fails, however, because the type variable
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">'a</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> appears in the assumption of the theorem returned by
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ASSUME&nbsp;(Term&nbsp;`!x:'a.&nbsp;f&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;x`)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Failure will also occur in situations like:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - REWR_CONV (ASSUME (Term `f (n:num) = n`)) (Term `f 2:num`);
   ! Uncaught exception:
   ! HOL_ERR
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
where the left-hand side of the supplied equation contains a free
variable (in this case </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) which is also free in the assumptions, but which
must be instantiated in order to match the input term.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
