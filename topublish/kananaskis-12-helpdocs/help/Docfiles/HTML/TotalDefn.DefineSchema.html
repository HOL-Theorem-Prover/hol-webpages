&lsquo;recursion schemas&lsquo;. These are just recursive functions with extra

<SPAN class = "TEXT">The termination constraints of a schematic definition are collected on
the hypotheses of the definition, and also on the hypotheses of the
automatically proved induction theorem, but a termination proof is only
attempted when the termination conditions have no occurrences of
parameters. This is because, in general, termination can only be proved
after some of the parameters of the schema have been instantiated.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The original recursion equations, in which parameters only occur on
right hand sides, is transformed into one in which the parameters become
arguments to the function being defined. This is the expected
behaviour. If an argument intended as a parameter occurs on the left
hand side in the original recursion equations, it becomes universally
quantified in the termination conditions, which is not desirable for a
schema.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
