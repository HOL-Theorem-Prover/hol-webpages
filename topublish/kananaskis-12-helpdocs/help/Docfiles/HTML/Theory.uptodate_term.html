<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Operations in the current theory segment of HOL allow one to redefine
types and constants. This can cause theorems to become invalid. As a
result, HOL has a rudimentary consistency maintenance system built
around the notion of whether type operators and term constants are
&ldquo;up-to-date&rdquo;.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">An invocation </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">uptodate_term&nbsp;M</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> checks </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">M</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to see if it has been built
from any out-of-date components. The definition of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">out-of-date</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is
mutually recursive among types, terms, and theorems. If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">M</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a
variable, it is out-of-date if its type is out-of-date. If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">M</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a
constant, it is out-of-date if it has been redeclared, or if its type is
out-of-date, or if the witness theorem used to justify its existence
is out-of-date.  If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">M</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a combination, it is out-of-date if either
of its components are out-of-date. If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">M</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is an abstraction, it is
out-of-date if either the bound variable or the body is out-of-date.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">All items from ancestor theories are fixed, and unable to
be overwritten, thus are always up-to-date.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
