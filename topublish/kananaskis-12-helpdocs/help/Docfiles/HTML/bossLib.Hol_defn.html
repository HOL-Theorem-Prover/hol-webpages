<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">An invocation of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Hol_defn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is usually the first step in a multi-step
process that ends with unconstrained recursion equations for a
function, along with an induction theorem. </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Hol_defn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is used to
construct the function and synthesize its termination conditions;
next, one invokes </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tgoal</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to set up a goal to prove termination of the
function.  The termination proof usually starts with an invocation of
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">WF_REL_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. After the proof is over, the desired recursion equations

<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">It is occasionally important to understand, at least in part, how
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Hol_defn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> constructs termination constraints. In some cases, it is
necessary for users to influence this process in order to have correct
termination constraints extracted. The process is driven by so-called
congruence theorems for particular HOL constants. For example, suppose
we were interested in defining a &lsquo;destructor-style&lsquo; version of the
factorial function over natural numbers:

<SPAN class = "TEXT">This theorem is interpreted by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Hol_defn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> as an ordered sequence of
instructions to follow when the termination condition extractor hits an
&lsquo;if-then-else&lsquo;. The theorem is read as follows:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   When an instance `if B then X else Y` is encountered while the
   extractor traverses the function definition, do the following:

     1. Go into B and extract termination conditions TCs(B) from
        any recursive calls in it. This returns a theorem
        TCs(B) |- B = B'.

     2. Assume B' and extract termination conditions from any
        recursive calls in X. This returns a theorem
        TCs(X) |- X = X'. Each element of TCs(X) will have
        the form "B' ==&gt; M".

     3. Assume ~B' and extract termination conditions from any
        recursive calls in Y. This returns a theorem
        TCs(Y) |- Y = Y'. Each element of TCs(Y) will have
        the form "~B' ==&gt; M".

     4. By equality reasoning with (1), (2), and (3), derive

            TCs(B) u TCs(X) u TCs(Y)
             |-
            (if B then X else Y) = (if B' then X' else Y')

     5. Replace "if B then X else Y" by "if B' then X' else Y'".

<SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The accumulated termination conditions are propagated until the
extraction process finishes, and appear as hypotheses in the final
result. In our example, context is properly accounted for in recursive

<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Now we discuss congruence theorems for higher-order functions. A
&lsquo;higher-order&lsquo; recursion is one in which a higher-order function is
used to apply the recursive function to arguments. In order for the
correct termination conditions to be proved for such a recursion,
congruence rules for the higher order function must be known to
the termination condition extraction mechanism. Congruence rules for
common higher-order functions, e.g., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">MAP</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">EVERY</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">EXISTS</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> for
lists, are already known to the mechanism. However, at times, one must
manually prove and install a congruence theorem for a higher-order
function.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">For example, suppose we define a higher-order function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">SIGMA</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> for
summing the results of a function in a list. We then use </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">SIGMA</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in
