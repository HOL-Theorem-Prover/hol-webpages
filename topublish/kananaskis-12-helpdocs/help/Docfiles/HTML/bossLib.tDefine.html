<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tDefine</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a definition package similar to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Define</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> except that it
has a tactic parameter which is used to perform the termination proof
for the specified function. </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tDefine</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> accepts the same syntax used by
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Define</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> for specifying functions.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If the specification is a simple abbreviation, or is primitive
recursive (i.e., it exactly follows the recursion pattern
of a previously declared HOL datatype) then the invocation of
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tDefine</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> succeeds and stores the derived equations in the
current theory segment. Otherwise, the function is not an instance of
primitive recursion, and the termination prover may succeed or fail.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">When processing the specification of a recursive function,
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tDefine</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> must perform a termination proof. It automatically constructs
termination conditions for the function, and invokes the supplied
tactic in an attempt to prove the termination conditions. If that
attempt fails, then </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tDefine</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If it succeeds, then </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tDefine</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> stores the specified equations in the
current theory segment, using the string argument as a stem for the name.
An induction theorem customized for the defined function is also
stored in the current segment. Note, however, that an induction
theorem is not stored for primitive recursive functions, since that
theorem would be identical to the induction theorem resulting from the
declaration of the datatype.</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tDefine</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails if it cannot prove the termination of the
specified recursive function. In that case, one has to embark on the
following multi-step process: (1) construct the function and synthesize its
termination conditions with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Hol_defn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">; (2) set up a goal to prove the
termination conditions with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tgoal</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">; (3) interactively prove the
termination conditions, usually by starting with an invocation of
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">WF_REL_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">; and (4) package everything up with an invocation
of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tDefine</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
