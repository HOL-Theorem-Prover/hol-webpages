<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ARITH_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a partial decision procedure for Presburger natural
arithmetic. Presburger natural arithmetic is the subset of arithmetic formulae
made up from natural number constants, numeric variables, addition,
multiplication by a constant, the relations </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&lt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&lt;=</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">=</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&gt;=</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&gt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and the
logical connectives </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">~</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">/\</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">\/</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">==&gt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">=</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (if-and-only-if), </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">!</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (&lsquo;forall&rsquo;)
and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">?</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (&lsquo;there exists&rsquo;). Products of two expressions which both contain
variables are not included in the subset, but the functions </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">SUC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">PRE</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
which are not normally included in a specification of Presburger arithmetic
are allowed in this HOL implementation.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ARITH_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> further restricts the subset as follows: when the formula has been
put in prenex normal form it must contain only one kind of quantifier, that is
the quantifiers must either all be universal (&lsquo;forall&rsquo;) or all existential.
Variables may appear free (unquantified) provided any quantifiers that do
appear in the prenex normal form are universal; free variables are taken as
being implicitly universally quantified so mixing them with existential
quantifiers would violate the above restriction.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Given a formula in the permitted subset, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ARITH_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> attempts to prove that
it is equal to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">T</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (true). For universally quantified formulae the procedure
only works if the formula would also be true of the non-negative rationals;
it cannot prove formulae whose truth depends on the integral properties of the
natural numbers. The procedure is also incomplete for existentially quantified
formulae, but in this case there is no rule-of-thumb for determining whether
the procedure will work.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The function features a number of preprocessors which extend the coverage
beyond the subset specified above. In particular, natural number subtraction
and conditional statements are allowed. Another permits substitution instances
of universally quantified formulae to be accepted. Note that Boolean-valued
variables are not allowed.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The function can fail in two ways. It fails if the argument term is not a
formula in the specified subset, and it also fails if it is unable to prove
the formula. The failure strings are different in each case. However, the
function may announce that it is unable to prove a formula that one would
expect it to reject as being outside the subset. This is due to it looking for
substitution instances; it has generalised the formula so that the new formula
is in the subset but is not valid.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">A simple example containing a free variable:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - ARITH_CONV ``m &lt; SUC m``;
   &gt; val it = |- m &lt; (SUC m) = T : thm
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
A more complex example with subtraction and universal quantifiers, and
which is not initially in prenex normal form:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - ARITH_CONV
     ``!m p. p &lt; m ==&gt; !q r. (m &lt; (p + q) + r) ==&gt; ((m - p) &lt; q + r)``;
   &gt; val it = |- (!m p. p &lt; m ==&gt; (!q r. m &lt; ((p + q) + r) ==&gt; (m - p) &lt; (q + r))) = T
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Two examples with existential quantifiers:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - ARITH_CONV ``?m n. m &lt; n``;
   &gt; val it = |- (?m n. m &lt; n) = T

   - ARITH_CONV ``?m n. (2 * m) + (3 * n) = 10``;
   &gt; val it = |- (?m n. (2 * m) + (3 * n) = 10) = T
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
An instance of a universally quantified formula involving a conditional
statement and subtraction:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - ARITH_CONV
     ``((p + 3) &lt;= n) ==&gt; (!m. ((m EXP 2 = 0) =&gt; (n - 1) | (n - 2)) &gt; p)``;
   &gt; val it = |- (p + 3) &lt;= n ==&gt; (!m. ((m EXP 2 = 0) =&gt; n - 1 | n - 2) &gt; p) = T
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Failure due to mixing quantifiers:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - ARITH_CONV ``!m. ?n. m &lt; n``;
   evaluation failed     ARITH_CONV -- formula not in the allowed subset
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Failure because the truth of the formula relies on the fact that the
variables cannot have fractional values:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - ARITH_CONV ``!m n. ~(SUC (2 * m) = 2 * n)``;
   evaluation failed     ARITH_CONV -- cannot prove formula
