<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">expand_listf</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a faster version of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">expand_list</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.
It does not use a validated version of the list-tactic.
That is, no check is made that the justification of the list-tactic
does prove the goals from the subgoals it generates.
If an invalid list-tactic is used,
the theorem ultimately proved may not match the goal originally set.
Alternatively, failure may occur when the justifications
are applied in which case the theorem would not be proved. For a description of
the subgoal package, see under </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">set_goal</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

for the current goal list. It will diverge if the list-tactic diverges
for the goals. It will fail if there are no
unproven goals. This could be because no goal has been set using </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">set_goal</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> or
because the last goal set has been completely proved. If an invalid tactic,
whose justification actually fails, has been used earlier in the proof,
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">expand_listf&nbsp;ltac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> may succeed in applying </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ltac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and apparently prove
