applied top-down and recursively on the goal, until no more matches are found.
The order in which the set of rewrite equations is applied is an implementation
matter and the user should not depend on any ordering. Rewriting strategies are
described in more detail under </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">GEN_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. For omitting the common
