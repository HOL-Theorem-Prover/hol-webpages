<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">IMP_RES_THEN</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is the basic building block for resolution
in HOL.  This is not full higher-order, or even first-order,
resolution with unification, but simply one way simultaneous
pattern-matching (resulting in term and type instantiation) of the
antecedent of an implicative theorem to the conclusion of another
theorem (the candidate antecedent).</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Given a theorem-tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ttac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and a theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the theorem-tactical
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">IMP_RES_THEN</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> uses </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_CANON</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to derive a canonical list of
implications from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, each of which has the form:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   Ai |- !x1...xn. ui ==&gt; vi
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">IMP_RES_THEN</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> then produces a tactic that, when applied to
a goal </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A&nbsp;?-&nbsp;g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> attempts to match each antecedent </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ui</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to each
assumption </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">aj&nbsp;|-&nbsp;aj</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the assumptions </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  If the antecedent </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ui</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
of any implication matches the conclusion </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">aj</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> of any assumption, then
an instance of the theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Ai&nbsp;u&nbsp;{aj}&nbsp;|-&nbsp;vi</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, called a &lsquo;resolvent&rsquo;,
is obtained by specialization of the variables </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">xn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and
type instantiation, followed by an application of modus ponens.  There
may be more than one canonical implication and each implication is
tried against every assumption of the goal, so there may be several
resolvents (or, indeed, none).</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Tactics are produced using the theorem-tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ttac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> from all these
resolvents (failures of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ttac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> at this stage are filtered out) and
these tactics are then applied in an unspecified sequence to the goal.
That is,

   MAP_EVERY (mapfilter ttac [... , (Ai u {aj} |- vi) , ...]) (A ?- g)

<SPAN class = "TEXT">
where the theorems </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Ai&nbsp;u&nbsp;{aj}&nbsp;|-&nbsp;vi</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are all the
consequences that can be drawn by a (single) matching modus-ponens
inference from the assumptions of the goal </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A&nbsp;?-&nbsp;g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and the
implications derived from the supplied theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  The sequence in
which the theorems </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Ai&nbsp;u&nbsp;{aj}&nbsp;|-&nbsp;vi</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are generated and the

<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Evaluating </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">IMP_RES_THEN&nbsp;ttac&nbsp;th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails if the
supplied theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is not an implication, or if no implications can
be derived from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> by the transformation process described under the
entry for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_CANON</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  Evaluating </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">IMP_RES_THEN&nbsp;ttac&nbsp;th&nbsp;(A&nbsp;?-&nbsp;g)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
fails if no assumption of the goal </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A&nbsp;?-&nbsp;g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> can be resolved with the
implication or implications derived from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. Evaluation also fails
if there are resolvents, but for every resolvent </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Ai&nbsp;u&nbsp;{aj}&nbsp;|-&nbsp;vi</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
evaluating the application </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ttac&nbsp;(Ai&nbsp;u&nbsp;{aj}&nbsp;|-&nbsp;vi)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails---that
is, if for every resolvent </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ttac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails to produce a tactic. Finally,
failure is propagated if any of the tactics that are produced from
the resolvents by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ttac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails when applied in sequence to the goal.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The following example shows a straightforward use of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">IMP_RES_THEN</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to
infer an equational consequence of the assumptions of a goal, use it
once as a substitution in the conclusion of goal, and then &lsquo;throw it
away&rsquo;.  Suppose the goal is:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   a + n = a  ?- !k. k - n = k
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
By the built-in theorem:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   ADD_INV_0 = |- !m n. (m + n = m) ==&gt; (n = 0)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
the assumption of this goal implies that </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> equals </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">0</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  A
single-step resolution with this theorem followed by substitution:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   IMP_RES_THEN SUBST1_TAC ADD_INV_0
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
can therefore be used to reduce the goal to:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   a + n = a  ?- !k. k - 0 = m
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Here, a single resolvent </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">a&nbsp;+&nbsp;n&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;|-&nbsp;n&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is obtained by
matching the antecedent of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ADD_INV_0</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to the assumption of the goal.
This is then used to substitute </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">0</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the conclusion of the
goal.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
