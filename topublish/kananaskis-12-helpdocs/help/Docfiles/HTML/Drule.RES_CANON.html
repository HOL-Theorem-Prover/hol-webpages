<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Put an implication into canonical form for resolution.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">All the HOL resolution tactics (e.g. </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">IMP_RES_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) work by using
modus ponens to draw consequences from an implicative theorem and the
assumptions of the goal.  Some of these tactics derive this
implication from a theorem supplied explicitly the user (or otherwise
from &lsquo;outside&rsquo; the goal) and some obtain it from the assumptions of
the goal itself.  But in either case, the supplied theorem or
assumption is first transformed into a list of implications in
&lsquo;canonical&rsquo; form by the function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_CANON</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The theorem argument to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_CANON</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> should be either be an implication
(which can be universally quantified) or a theorem from which an
implication can be derived using the transformation rules discussed
below.  Given such a theorem, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_CANON</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> returns a list of
implications in canonical form.  It is the implications in this
resulting list that are used by the various resolution tactics to
infer consequences from the assumptions of a goal.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The transformations done by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_CANON&nbsp;th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to the theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are as
follows.  First, if </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a negation </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A&nbsp;|-&nbsp;~t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, this is converted to
the implication </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A&nbsp;|-&nbsp;t&nbsp;==&gt;&nbsp;F</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  The following inference rules are
then applied repeatedly, until no further rule applies. Conjunctions
are split into their components and equivalence (boolean equality) is
split into implication in both directions:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
      A |- t1 /\ t2                         A |- t1 = t2
   --------------------           ----------------------------------
    A |- t1    A |- t2             A |- t1 ==&gt; t2    A |- t2 ==&gt; t1
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Conjunctive antecedents are transformed by:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
                A |- (t1 /\ t2) ==&gt; t
   ---------------------------------------------------
    A |- t1 ==&gt; (t2 ==&gt; t)     A |- t2 ==&gt; (t1 ==&gt; t)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
and disjunctive antecedents by:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
        A |- (t1 \/ t2) ==&gt; t
   --------------------------------
    A |- t1 ==&gt; t    A |- t2 ==&gt; t
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The scope of universal quantifiers is restricted, if possible:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
    A |- !x. t1 ==&gt; t2
   --------------------         [if x is not free in t1]
    A |- t1 ==&gt; !x. t2
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
and existentially-quantified antecedents are eliminated by:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
      A |- (?x. t1) ==&gt; t2
   ---------------------------  [x' chosen so as not to be free in t2]
    A |- !x'. t1[x'/x] ==&gt; t2
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Finally, when no further applications of the above rules are
possible, and the theorem is an implication:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   A |- !x1...xn. t1 ==&gt; t2
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
then the theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A&nbsp;u&nbsp;{t1}&nbsp;|-&nbsp;t2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is transformed by a recursive
application of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_CANON</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to get a list of theorems:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   [A u {t1} |- t21 , ... , A u {t1} |- t2n]
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
and the result of discharging </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> from these theorems:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   [A |- !x1...xn. t1 ==&gt; t21 , ... , A |- !x1...xn. t1 ==&gt; t2n]
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
is returned. That is, the transformation rules are recursively
applied to the conclusions of all implications.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_CANON&nbsp;th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails if no implication(s) can be derived from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
using the transformation rules shown above.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The uniqueness of the remainder </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">k&nbsp;MOD&nbsp;n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is expressed in HOL by the

<SPAN class = "TEXT">
For this theorem, the canonical list of implications returned by
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_CANON</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is as follows:

The existentially-quantified, conjunctive, antecedent has given rise
to two implications, and the scope of universal quantifiers has been
restricted to the conclusions of the resulting implications wherever
possible.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">USES</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The primary use of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_CANON</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is for the (internal) pre-processing

</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_CANON</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is also made available at top-level so that users can call
it to see the actual form of the implications used for resolution in
