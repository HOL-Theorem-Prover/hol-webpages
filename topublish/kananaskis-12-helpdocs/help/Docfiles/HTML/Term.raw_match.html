</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">avoid_tys</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">avoid_tms</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> specify type and term variables in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pat</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">

<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The pair </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(tmS,tyS)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is an accumulator argument. This allows </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">raw_match</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">

with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(tmS,tyS)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. This means that if there is a </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">{redex,residue}</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">TmS</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
and also a </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">{redex,residue}</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tmS</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> so that both </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">redex</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fields are
equal, then the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">residue</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fields must be alpha-convertible. Similarly
for types: if there is a </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">{redex,residue}</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">TyS</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and also a
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">{redex,residue}</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tyS</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> so that both </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">redex</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fields are equal, then
the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">residue</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fields must also be equal. If these conditions hold, then
the result-pair </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(TmS,TyS)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> includes </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(tmS,tyS)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Finally, note that the result also includes a set (resp. a list) of
term and type variables, accompanying the substitutions. These
represent identity bindings that have occurred in the process of doing
the match. If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">raw_match</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is to be folded across multiple problems,
these output values will need to be merged with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">avoid_tms</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">avoid_tys</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> respectively on the next call so that they cannot be
instantiated a second time. Because they are identity bindings, they
do not need to be referred to in validating the central identity
above.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

One of the main differences between </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">raw_match</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and more refined
derivatives of it, is that the returned substitutions are
un-normalized by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">raw_match</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. If one naively applied </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(S,T)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">\x:'a.&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;f&nbsp;(y:'b)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, type instantiation with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">T</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> would be applied
first, yielding </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">\x:bool.&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;f&nbsp;(y:bool)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. Then substitution with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">S</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
would be applied, unsuccessfully, since both </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">y</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the
pattern term have been type instantiated, but the corresponding
elements of the substitution haven&rsquo;t. Thus, higher level operations
building on </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">raw_match</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> typically instantiate </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">S</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">T</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to get </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">S'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
before applying </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(S',T)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to the pattern term. This can be achieved by
using </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">norm_subst</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. However, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">raw_match</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> exposes this level of detail
to the programmer.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
