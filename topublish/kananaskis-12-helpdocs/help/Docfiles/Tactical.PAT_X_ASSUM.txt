----------------------------------------------------------------------
PAT_X_ASSUM : term -> thm_tactic -> tactic

SYNOPSIS
Finds the first assumption that matches the term argument, applies
the theorem tactic to it, and removes this assumption.

KEYWORDS
theorem-tactical, assumption.

DESCRIBE
The tactic

   PAT_X_ASSUM tm ttac ([A1, ..., An], g)

finds the first {Ai} which matches {tm} using higher-order pattern
matching in the sense of {ho_match_term}. Free variables in the
pattern that are also free in the assumptions or the goal must not be
bound by the match. In effect, these variables are being treated as
local constants.

FAILURE
Fails if the term doesnâ€™t match any of the assumptions, or if the
theorem-tactic fails when applied to the first assumption that does
match the term.
