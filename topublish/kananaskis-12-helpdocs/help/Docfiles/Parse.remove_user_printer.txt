remove_user_printer :
  string -> (term * term_grammar.userprinter) option

SYNOPSIS
Removes a user-defined pretty-printing function associated with a
particular name.

KEYWORDS
Pretty-printing.

LIBRARY
Parse

DESCRIBE
This removes the user-defined pretty-printing function that has been
associated with a particular name (the name of the code for the
function).  If there is such a printer in the global grammar for the
specified type, this is returned in the option type.  If there is no
printer, then {NONE} is returned.

FAILURE
Never fails.

COMMENTS
As always, there is an accompanying function
{temp_remove_user_printer}, which does not affect the grammar exported
to disk.

SEEALSO
Parse.add_user_printer.
