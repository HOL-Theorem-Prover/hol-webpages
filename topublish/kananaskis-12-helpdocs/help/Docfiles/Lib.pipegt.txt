SYNOPSIS
Infix operator for writing function application.

LIBRARY
Lib

DESCRIBE
The expression {x |> f} is equal to {f x}. This way of writing
application has two advantages, both apparent when multiple
functions are being applied.  Without using {|>}, one might write
{f (g (h x))}. With it, one writes {x |> h |> g |> f}.  The latter
form needs fewer parentheses, and also makes the order in which
functions will operate correspond to a left-to-right reading.

FAILURE
Never fails.
