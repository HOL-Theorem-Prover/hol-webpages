eta : tactic -> proof

SYNOPSIS
Applies a tactic to all goals, on which it succeeds, in the current goal list,
replacing the list with the resulting subgoals.

DESCRIBE
{eta tac} tries to apply {tac} to all the goals in the current goal list;
replacing the goal list with the list of all the resulting subgoals.
If it fails on a goal, it has no effect on that goal.
It is an abbreviation for {expand_list (TRYALL tac)}.

USES
For interactively constructing suitable compound tactics:
in an interactive proof, the effect of {e (tac1 THEN TRY tac2)}
can be obtained by {e tac1} and then {eta tac2}.

SEEALSO
proofManagerLib.expand_list, proofManagerLib.elt, Tactical.TRYALL,
Tactical.TRY, proofManagerLib.eall, proofManagerLib.set_goal.
