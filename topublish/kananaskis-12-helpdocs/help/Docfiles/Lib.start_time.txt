start_time : unit -> Timer.cpu_timer

SYNOPSIS
Set a timer running.

KEYWORDS
time.

DESCRIBE
An application {start_time ()} creates a timer and starts it. A later
invocation {end_time t}, where {t} is a timer, will need to be called
to get the elapsed time between the two function calls.

FAILURE
Never fails.

EXAMPLE

- val clock = start_time ();
> val clock = <cpu_timer> : cpu_timer




COMMENTS
Multiple timers may be started without any interfering with the others.

Further operations associated with the type {cpu_timer} may be found
in the Standard ML Basis Library structures {Timer} and {Time}.

SEEALSO
Lib.end_time, Lib.time.
