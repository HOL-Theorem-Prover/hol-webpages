----------------------------------------------------------------------
SUFF_TAC : term -> tactic

SYNOPSIS
Introduces an implicational subgoal.

KEYWORDS
tactic

DESCRIBE
A call to {SUFF_TAC t} on the goal {asl ?- g} introduces two subgoals:
{asl ?- t ==> g} and {asl ?- t}.  At a high-level, the userâ€™s claim is
that term {t} suffices (hence the name) to prove the goal.  The first
new goal to be discharged is the check for this; the second is to actually
show {t}.

FAILURE
Will fail if {t} is not of type {:bool}.

SEEALSO
bossLib.suffices_by.
