datatype class

SYNOPSIS
Datatype for classifying theory elements.

DESCRIBE
Many of the functions in the {DB} structure return answers that involve
the {class} type, which is declared as

   datatype class = Thm | Axm | Def

When occurring with {th}, an ML value of type {thm},
{Axm} means that {th} has been asserted as an axiom; {Def} means that {th}
is a constant definition; and {Thm} means that {th} is a plain old theorem,
i.e,. not an axiom or a definition.

SEEALSO
DB.data.
