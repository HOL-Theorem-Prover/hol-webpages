eqtype term

SYNOPSIS
ML datatype of HOL terms.

KEYWORDS
term.

DESCRIBE
The ML abstract type {term} represents the set of HOL terms,
which is essentially the simply typed lambda calculus of Church. A term
may be a variable, a constant, an application of one term to another,
or a lambda abstraction.

COMMENTS
Since {term} is an ML eqtype, any two {term}s {tm1} and {tm2}
can be tested for equality by {tm1 = tm2}. However, the fundamental
notion of equality for terms is implemented by {aconv}.

Since term is an abstract type, access to its representation is mediated
by the interface presented by the {Term} structure.
