AP_TERM                                                          (Thm)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
AP_TERM : term -> thm -> thm

SYNOPSIS
Applies a function to both sides of an equational theorem.

KEYWORDS
rule.

DESCRIBE
When applied to a term {f} and a theorem {A |- x = y}, the
inference rule {AP_TERM} returns the theorem {A |- f x = f y}.

      A |- x = y
   ----------------  AP_TERM f
    A |- f x = f y




FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is equational and the supplied term is a function
whose domain type is the same as the type of both sides of the equation.
