type ('a,'b) istream

SYNOPSIS
Type of imperative streams.

KEYWORDS
stream.

DESCRIBE
The type {('a,'b) istream} is an abstract type of imperative streams.
These may be created with {mk_istream}, advanced by {next},
accessed by {state}, and reset with {reset}.

COMMENTS
Purely functional streams are well-known in functional programming, and
more elegant. However, this type proved useful in implementing some
imperative ‘gensym’-like algorithms used in HOL.

SEEALSO
Lib.mk_istream, Lib.next, Lib.state, Lib.reset.
