enth : tactic -> int -> proof

SYNOPSIS
Applies a tactic to one goal, referenced by number, in the current goal list,
replacing that goal with the resulting subgoals.

DESCRIBE
{enth tac i} applies {tac} to all the iâ€™th goal in the current goal list,
replacing that goal in the goal list with the subgoals produced by {tac}.
It is an abbreviation for {expand_list (NTH_GOAL tac i)}.

USES
For interactively constructing suitable compound tactics,
for example to test whether a particular subgoal can be proved easily,
before attacking the other subgoals.
