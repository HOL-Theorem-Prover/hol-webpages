</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_recursive_definition</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> can be used to define primitive recursive
functions over binary trees.  Suppose the value of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is this theorem.  Then
a recursive function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Leaves</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, which computes the number of leaves in a

The result is a theorem which states that the constant </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Leaves</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">

<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The function defined using </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_recursive_definition</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> need not, in fact, be
recursive.  Here is the definition of a predicate </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">IsLeaf</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, which is true of
binary trees which are leaves, but is false of the internal nodes in a binary
tree:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>

Note that the equations defining a (recursive or non-recursive)
function on binary trees by cases can be given in either order.  Here, the
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">NODE</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> case is given first, and the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">LEAF</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> case second.  The reverse order was
used in the above definition of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Leaves</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_recursive_definition</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> also allows the user to partially specify the value
of a function defined on a concrete type, by allowing defining equations for
some of the constructors to be omitted.  Here, for example, is the definition
of a function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Label</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> which extracts the label from a leaf node.  The value of
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Label</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> applied to an internal node is left unspecified:

Curried functions can also be defined, and the recursion can be on
any argument.  The next definition defines an infix function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&lt;&lt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> which
