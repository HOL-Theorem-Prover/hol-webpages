<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Construct a theorem without proof, and tag it.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">In principle, nearly every theorem of interest can be proved in HOL by
using only the axioms and primitive rules of inference. The use of ML
to orchestrate larger inference steps from the primitives, along with
support in HOL for goal-directed proof, considerably eases the task
of formal proof. Nearly every theorem of interest can therefore be
produced as the end product of a chain of primitive inference steps,
and HOL implementations strive to keep this purity.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">However, it is occasionally useful to interface HOL with trusted
external tools that also produce, in some sense, theorems that would be
derivable in HOL. It is clearly a burden to require that HOL proofs
accompany such theorems so that they can be (re-)derived in HOL. In order
to support greater interoperation of proof tools, therefore, HOL provides
the notion of a &lsquo;tagged&rsquo; theorem.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">A tagged theorem is manufactured by invoking </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">mk_oracle_thm&nbsp;tag&nbsp;(A,w)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">,
where </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a list of HOL terms of type </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">bool</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">w</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is also a HOL
term of boolean type. No proof is done; the sequent is merely injected
into the type of theorems, and the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tag</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> value is attached to it. The
result is the theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A&nbsp;|-&nbsp;w</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tag</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> value stays with the theorem, and it propagates in a
hereditary fashion to any theorem derived from the tagged theorem.
Thus, if one examines a theorem with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Thm.tag</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and finds that it has
no tag, then the theorem has been derived purely by proof steps
in the HOL logic. Otherwise, shortcuts have been taken, and the
external tools, also known as &lsquo;oracles&rsquo;, used to make the shortcuts
are signified by the tags.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
