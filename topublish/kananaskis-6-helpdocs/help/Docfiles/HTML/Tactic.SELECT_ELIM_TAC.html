<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">SELECT_ELIM_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> searches the goal it is applied to for terms
involving the Hilbert-choice operator, of the form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">@x.&nbsp;...</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  If such
a term is found, then the tactic will produce a new goal, where the
choice term has disappeared.  The resulting goal will require the
proof of the non-emptiness of the choice term&rsquo;s predicate, and that
any possible choice of value from that predicate will satisfy the
original goal.</SPAN>
