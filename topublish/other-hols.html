<h1>Other Higher Order Logic Theorem-Proving Systems</h1>

<p>There are three other systems implementing the same logic as HOL4:

<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/jrh/hol-light/">HOL Light</a>, by John Harrison and written in OCaml;

<a href="http://www.lemma-one.com/ProofPower/index/">ProofPower</a>, by Rob Arthan and written in SML; and

<a href="http://proof-technologies.com/holzero/index.html">HOL Zero</a>, by Mark Adams and written in OCaml.</p>

<p id="isabelle">The HOL provided by
the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/">Isabelle
system</a> (often written “Isabelle/HOL”) is very similar to the
higher order logic of HOL4, HOL&nbsp;Light and ProofPower, but has a
type system with Haskell-like type-classes.</p>

<p id="pvs">The <a href="http://pvs.csl.sri.com/">PVS system</a> has a
  type system with predicate sub-typing.  Getting a term (formula,
  definition) to typecheck can require arbitrary amounts of work, but
  definitions are a deal more expressive.</p>

<p id="holomega">The <a href="http://www.trustworthytools.com/id17.html">HOL-ω
system</a> implements a
  sophisticated type system (like that of <i>System F<sub>ω</sub></i>)
  that also remains a superset of HOL4’s.  In terms of implementation,
  the system is also a drop-in replacement for HOL4: all existing HOL4
  scripts should continue to work as before in HOL-ω. </p>
