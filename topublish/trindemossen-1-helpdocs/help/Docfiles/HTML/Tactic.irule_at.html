<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">A call to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">irule_at&nbsp;pos&nbsp;th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> an “implicational” theorem of
general form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">∀xs...&nbsp;P&nbsp;⇒&nbsp;Q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, will attempt to find an instance of term
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> at position </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pos</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> within the current goal, and replace it with an
appropriately instantiated version of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">P</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. (It is possible for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">P</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to
be empty, in which case the term is effectively replaced by truth.)
The possible positions encoded by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pos</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are all “positive”, meaning
that this process is sound (it may nonetheless turn a provable goal
into an unprovable one).</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The possible positions encoded by parameter </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pos</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> view the goal as if
it is of form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">?ys.&nbsp;c1&nbsp;∧&nbsp;...&nbsp;∧&nbsp;cn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, where the existential prefix </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ys</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
may be empty, and where there may only be one conjunct. If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pos</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
encodes the choice of conjunct </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">cj</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, then </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">irule_at&nbsp;pos</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will
instantiate type variables and term variables from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">xs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, and
variables from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ys</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the goal so as to make </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">cj</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> unify with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The
conjunct </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">cj</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will then be replaced with the correspondingly
instantiated </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">P</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, which may itself be multiple conjunctions. While the
goal may lose variables from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ys</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> because they have been instantiated,
it may also acquire new variables from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">xs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">; these will be added to
the goal&rsquo;s existential prefix.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The new goal will be assembled to put new conjuncts first, followed by
conjuncts from the original goal in their original order (these
conjuncts may still be different if existential variables from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ys</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
have been instantiated). If two conjuncts become the same because of
variable instantiation, only one will be present in the resulting
goal. There is some effort made to keep variables from the existential
prefix with the same names, but some renaming may occur, and the new
goal&rsquo;s existential variables will be ordered arbitrarily. If the new
goal has no conjuncts, then the tactic has proved the original.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">There are four possible forms for the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pos</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> parameter. If it is of
form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Pos&nbsp;f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will be a function of type </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">term&nbsp;list&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;term</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, and
this function will be passed the list of conjuncts. The returned term
should be one of those conjuncts. Typical values for this function are
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">hd</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">last</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">el&nbsp;i</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, for positive integers </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">i</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. If the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pos</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
parameter is of form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Pat&nbsp;q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the quotation </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will be parsed in the
context of the goal (honouring the goal&rsquo;s free variables), generating
a set of possible terms (multiple terms are possible because of
ambiguities caused by overloading) that are then viewed as patterns
against which the conjuncts of the goal are matched. The first
conjunct that matches the earliest pattern in the sequence of possible
parses, and which unifies with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">&rsquo;s conclusion, is used.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The pattern form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Concl</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is used to indicate that the entire goal
(including its existential prefix) should be viewed as the desired
target for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. This results in a call to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">irule&nbsp;th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> being made.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Finally, the pattern form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Any</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is used to have the tactic search for
any conjunct that matches the conclusion (as with a pattern of
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">‘_:bool’</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">), and if no conjunct unifies with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">&rsquo;s conclusion, to
then try to call </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">irule&nbsp;th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, as is done with the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Concl</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> pattern form.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Fails if the position parameter fails to specify a term, or if that
term does not unify with the implicational theorem&rsquo;s conclusion. A
position may fail to specify a term in mulitple ways depending on the
form of the position. A position of form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Pos&nbsp;f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will fail if the
function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails when applied to the goal&rsquo;s conjuncts. (Note that
there is no failure if </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> returns a term that is not actually a
conjunct; if this term unifies, this will simply result in new
conjuncts appearing in the goal without any old conjuncts being
removed.)</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">A position of form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Pat&nbsp;q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> can fail if no conjunct of the goal matches
any of the terms parsed to by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The other position forms always
return at least one term to be considered. Failure after this point
will only follow if none of these terms unifies with the implicational
theorem&rsquo;s conclusion.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
