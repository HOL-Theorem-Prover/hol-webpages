<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Simplifies assumptions and goal conclusion until a normal form is reached.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">A call to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">gs&nbsp;ths</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> produces a simplification tactic that repeatedly
simplifies with the theorems </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ths</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the stateful simpset, the natural
number arithmetic decision procedure and normalizer, and
let-elimination (as done by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">simp</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) over both a goal&rsquo;s assumptions and
the goal&rsquo;s conclusion.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Assumptions are simplified first, with assumption terms simplified in
turn in a context that includes all of the other assumptions. After
simplification, if an assumption has been reduced to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">T</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (truth), it
is dropped. Otherwise, it is added back to the assumption list using
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">STRIP_ASSUME_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. After this process of assumption simplification
produces no further change (assessed using </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">CHANGED_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">), the goal&rsquo;s
conclusion is also simplified, in a context that assumes all of the
(now simplified) asssumptions.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Theorems with restrictions (</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Once</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Ntimes</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) passed to the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">gs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
tactic will not have those restrictions refreshed as invocations of
the base simplification procedure are repeated. This means that the
restricted theorems will likely only be applied to the first
assumption where the left-hand-sides match.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">SUB_CANCEL</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> has two preconditions:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   &gt; arithmeticTheory.SUB_CANCEL;
   val it = ⊢ ∀p n m. n ≤ p ∧ m ≤ p ⇒ (p − n = p − m ⇔ n = m): thm
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
If those preconditions are distributed awkwardly in a goal, neither
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">fs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> nor </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">rfs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (which make passes over the assumptions in a particular
order) may be able to apply the rewrite. However, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">gs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will make
progress:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   x ≤ b, b - x = b - y, y ≤ b   ?- x * y &lt; 10
  ==============================================  gs[SUB_CANCEL]
           y ≤ b, x = y          ?- y ** 2 &lt; 10

<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">COMMENTS</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The accompanying functions </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">gvs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">gnvs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">gns</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are similar, but
tweak the behaviours slightly. The functions with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in their name
eliminate equalities (the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;y</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the example above, say), and the
functions with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the name do not use </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">STRIP_ASSUME_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> when
adding assumptions back to the goal. The latter can prevent
case-splits.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">rgs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> variant attacks the assumptions in the reverse order to
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">gs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The latter simplifies older assumptions using newer assumptions,
but </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">rgs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> uses the opposite order. If, for example, the assumption
list includes both </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">0&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">n&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, then </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">gs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will preserve one of
these and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">rgs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will preserve the other.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
