<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">If a user requires shared memory between workers,
it is possible to rely on smlParallel.parmap_queue (or Parmap.parmap).
However, in general it is quite difficult to obtain a significant speed-up
when calling smlParallel.parmap_queue (or Parmap.parmap). One reason is that
the threads need to be stopped temporarily during garbage collection.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
