<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Starting  an interactive proof session with the subgoal package.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The subgoal package implements a simple framework for interactive goal-directed
 proof.  When conducting a proof that involves many subgoals and
tactics, the user must keep track of all the justifications and compose them
in the correct order.  While this is feasible even in large proofs, it is
tedious.  The subgoal package provides a way of building and traversing the
tree of subgoals top-down, stacking the justifications and applying them
properly.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The package maintains a proof state consisting of either a goal stack of
outstanding goals and a justification stack, or a theorem.  Tactics are used
to expand the current goal (the one on the top of the goal stack) into
subgoals and justifications. These are pushed onto the goal stack and
justification stack, respectively, to form a new proof state. Several
preceding proof states are saved and can be returned to if a mistake is made
in the proof.  The goal stack is divided into levels, a new level being
created each time a tactic is successfully applied to give new subgoals.
Alternatively a list-tactic can process the entire list of goals of the current
level to change that level (rather than creating a new level).
The subgoals of the current level may be considered in any order.
Levels of the goal stack may be collapsed so that subgoals of a previous level
appear as part of of the current level.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If a tactic solves the current goal (returns an empty subgoal list), then
its justification is used to prove a corresponding theorem. This theorem is
then incorporated into the justification of the parent goal. If the subgoal
was the last subgoal of the level, the level is removed and the parent
goal is proved using  its (new) justification. This process is repeated
until a level with unproven subgoals is reached.
The next goal on the goal stack then becomes the current goal.
If all the subgoals are proved, the resulting proof state consists
of the theorem proved by the justifications. This theorem may be accessed and
saved.</SPAN>
