<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">remove_termtok</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> removes parsing/printing rules from the global
grammar.  Rules to be removed are those that are for the term with the
given name (</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">term_name</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) and which include the string </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tok</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> as part of
their concrete representation.  If multiple rules satisfy this
criterion, they are all removed.  If none match, the grammar is not
changed.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">If one wished to revert to the traditional HOL syntax for conditional
expressions, this would be achievable as follows:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - remove_termtok {term_name = "COND", tok = "if"};
   &gt; val it = () : unit

   - Term`if p then q else r`;
   &lt;&lt;HOL message: inventing new type variable names: 'a, 'b, 'c, 'd, 'e, 'f.&gt;&gt;
   &gt; val it = `if p then q else r` : term

   - Term`p =&gt; q | r`;
   &lt;&lt;HOL message: inventing new type variable names: 'a.&gt;&gt;
   &gt; val it = `COND p q r` : term
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The first invocation of the parser above demonstrates that once the
rule for the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">if-then-else</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> syntax has been removed, a string that
used to parse as a conditional expression then parses as a big
function application (the function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">if</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> applied to five arguments).</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The fact that the pretty-printer does not print the term using the
old-style syntax, even after the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">if-then-else</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> rule has been removed,
is due to the fact that the corresponding rule in the grammar does not
have its preferred flag set.  This can be accomplished with
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">prefer_form_with_tok</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> as follows:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - prefer_form_with_tok {term_name = "COND", tok = "=&gt;"};
   &gt; val it = () : unit

   - Term`p =&gt; q | r`;
   &lt;&lt;HOL message: inventing new type variable names: 'a.&gt;&gt;
   &gt; val it = `p =&gt; q | r` : term

<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">USES</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Used to modify the global parsing/pretty-printing grammar by removing
a rule, possibly as a prelude to adding another rule which would
otherwise clash.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">COMMENTS</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">As with other functions in the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Parse</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> structure, there is a companion
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">temp_remove_termtok</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> function, which has the same effect on the global
grammar, but which does not cause this effect to persist when the
current theory is exported.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The specification of a rule by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">term_name</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and one of its tokens is
not perfect, but seems adequate in practice.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
