<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">When applied to the goal </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(asl,&nbsp;w)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q.MATCH_ABBREV_TAC&nbsp;q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
parses the quotation </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the context of the goal, producing a term
to use as a pattern.  The tactic then attempts a (first order) match
of the pattern against the term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">w</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  Variables that occur in both the
pattern and the goal are treated as &ldquo;local constants&rdquo;, and will not
acquire instantiations.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">For each variable </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the pattern that has not been treated as a
local constant, there will be an instantiation term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, such that the
substitution pattern </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">[v1&nbsp;|-&gt;&nbsp;t1,&nbsp;v2&nbsp;|-&gt;&nbsp;t2,&nbsp;...]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> produces </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">w</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The
effect of the tactic is to then perform abbreviations in the goal,
replacing each </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> with the corresponding </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (as long as </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> does not
have a name beginning with an underscore character), and adding
assumptions of the form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Abbrev(v&nbsp;=&nbsp;t)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to the goal.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Because the tactic ignores underscore variables, the user can
abbreviate just those parts of the goal that are particularly
relevant. Note also that the standard parser treats variables
consisting of entirely underscores specially: each is expanded to a
fresh name. This means that a pattern can use </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">_</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> repeatedly, and it
will not cause the match to look for the same instantiation for each
occurrence. Nor it will require corresponding sub-terms to have the
same type.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
