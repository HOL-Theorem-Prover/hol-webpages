<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Operations in the current theory segment of HOL allow one to redefine
types and constants. This can cause theorems to become invalid. As a
result, HOL has a rudimentary consistency maintenance system built
around the notion of whether type operators and term constants are
"up-to-date".</SPAN>

<SPAN class = "TEXT">An invocation </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">uptodate_type&nbsp;ty</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, checks </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ty</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to see if it has been

has.  The definition of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">out-of-date</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is mutually recursive among types,
terms, and theorems. A type variable never out-of-date. A compound
type is out-of-date if either (a) its type operator is out-of-date, or
(b) any of its argument types are out-of-date. A type operator is
out-of-date if it has been re-declared or if the witness theorem used to
justify the type in the call to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_type_definition</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is
out-of-date. Only a component of the current theory segment may be
out-of-date. All items from ancestor theories are fixed, and unable to
be overwritten, thus are always up-to-date.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
