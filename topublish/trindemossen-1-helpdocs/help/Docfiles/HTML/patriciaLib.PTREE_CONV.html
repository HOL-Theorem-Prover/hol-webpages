<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The conversion </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">PTREE_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is automatically added to the standard </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">compset</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  Thus, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">EVAL</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will have the same behaviour when </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">patriciaLib</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is loaded.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Run-times should be respectable when working with large Patricia trees.  However, this is predicated on the assumption that relatively small numbers of updates are made following an initial application of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Define_mk_ptree</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  In this sense, the Patricia tree development is best suited to situations where users require fast "read-only" look-up; where the work of building the look-up tree can be performed outside of the logic (i.e. in ML).</SPAN></DIV></DD>
