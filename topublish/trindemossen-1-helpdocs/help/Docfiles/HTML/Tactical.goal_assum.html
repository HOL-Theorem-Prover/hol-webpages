<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">An application of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">goal_assum&nbsp;ttac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to the goal </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(A,w0)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> can be seen
as a tactic that first transforms the goal into </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(w1::A,F)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (as if
starting a proof by contradiction, normalising </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">¬w0</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> into an
equivalent </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">w1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">); pops the new assumption </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">w1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and applies the
theorem-tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ttac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to this theorem (</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">w1&nbsp;⊢&nbsp;w1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">); and when this
completes, renormalises the conclusion of the goal if it has turned
into something of the form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">w2&nbsp;⇒&nbsp;F</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The first normalisation phase will turn something of the form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">¬p</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
into </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">p⇒F</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, and will also flip outermost existential quantifiers into
universals. Thus, if the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">w0</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> term was </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">∃x.&nbsp;P&nbsp;x&nbsp;∧&nbsp;Q&nbsp;(f&nbsp;x)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">w1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
term will be </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">∀x.&nbsp;P&nbsp;x&nbsp;∧&nbsp;Q&nbsp;(f&nbsp;x)&nbsp;⇒&nbsp;F</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The second normalisation phase
will undo this, so that if the effect of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ttac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is equivalent to a
call of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">MP_TAC&nbsp;th'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> a universally quantified implication
into falsity, then the goal will again become an existentially
