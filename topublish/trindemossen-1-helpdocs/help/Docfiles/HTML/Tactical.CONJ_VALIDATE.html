<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">A call to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">CONJ_VALIDATE&nbsp;tac&nbsp;g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> behaves the same as </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tac&nbsp;g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> if this
tactic application is valid (meaning that when the tactic&rsquo;s validation
function is applied to the resulting sub-goals, the generated theorem
has no more assumptions than the original goal).</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If the tactic&rsquo;s application is not valid because the resulting theorem
has the wrong conclusion, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">CONJ_VALIDATE&nbsp;tac&nbsp;g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will fail. If the
resulting theorem has hypotheses not present in the goal state, then
these hypotheses are added to the new goals as new proof obligations.
The way in which this addition is done depends on how many subgoals
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> generated when applied to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> completely solves </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (though in an invalid way), the excess
hypotheses </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">h1...hn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are bundled into a big conjunction and this
becomes the one remaining goal. If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tac&nbsp;g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> results in more than one
new goal, then </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">CONJ_VALIDATE&nbsp;tac&nbsp;g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will produce one extra goal,
consisting of a conjunction of hypotheses, as above. Finally, if
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tac&nbsp;g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> produces exactly one new goal to prove, and if the new goal&rsquo;s
assumptions are a subset of the original goal&rsquo;s, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">CONJ_VALIDATE&nbsp;tac&nbsp;g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
will do the same, but with the conjunction of extra hypotheses to
prove conjoined to that one goal&rsquo;s conclusion.  If there is one new
goal, but its assumptions are not a subset, then a separate sub-goal
is generated.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
