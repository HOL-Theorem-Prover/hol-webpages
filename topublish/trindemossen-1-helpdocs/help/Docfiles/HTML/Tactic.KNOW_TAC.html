<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is to be created through parsing a user-provided string, it may
be helpful to do that parsing in the context of the current goal, for
which </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> may be helpful.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Equally, the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">by</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">suffices_by</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> tactics have a similar effect:
taking a quotation, and generating two subgoals to be proved. In all
cases, the behaviour is to give the user an opportunity to be creative
in the specification of the fresh sub-goal that arises from applying
modus ponens backwards.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
