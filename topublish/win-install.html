<h1>The Windows Installer for HOL</h1>

<dl>
  <dt> <em>System requirements:</em>

  <dd> Windows&nbsp;NT, Windows&nbsp;2000, Windows&nbsp;XP, or
  Windows&nbsp;Vista.  In addition to the space required to store the
  installer executable (25MB), you will need approximately 180 MB of
  disk-space.

  <dt> <em>Using the installer:</em>
  <dd>
      <ul>
        <li> <p> You <strong>must</strong> have MoscowML&nbsp;2.01 installed
            before you running the installer.  In particular, this
            means that the environment variables <code>PATH</code> and
            <code>MOSMLLIB</code> must be correctly set.  Further, these
	    variables must be Windows environment variables (set through
	    the Control Panel).  It is not enough to have variables set just
	    for Cygwin shells.</p>

	    <p> The <a
	    href="http://www.dina.dk/~sestoft/mosml/mosml-2.01-1.exe">self-extracting
	    installer</a> for Moscow&nbsp;ML will normally set
	    environment variables correctly as part of its
	    installation process.</p>

        <li> <p>When Moscow ML is installed, you can install HOL by
            running the installer executable.  It will prompt you for
            the directory to install in.</p>

        <li> <p>Note that both the Moscow&nbsp;ML and HOL installers require the user to have administrative privileges.

        <li> <p>At the very end of the process, a DOS-like window will
            appear, and the system will attempt to configure itself.
            This process also involves the creation of many help
            files, and can take a little while.  If this window
            disappears almost instantly or with an error message, you
            probably haven’t installed Moscow ML correctly.  (See
	    <a href="win-details.html">here</a>
	    for more details.)</p>
      </ul>
  <dt> <em>Acknowledgements:</em>
  <dd> The self-installing executable was created with the freely
  available, and highly recommended, <a
  href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">InnoSetup</a> tool.

<h2>Unicode, UTF-8 and HOL4 on Windows</h2>

<p>If you run HOL4 in the standard “MS-DOS” <code>command.com</code> shell, or don’t have good enough fonts, lots of HOL output will look like gibberish. In this situation you will probably want to turn Unicode printing off when you run HOL.  Use
<pre>
       set_trace "Unicode" 0;
</pre>
<p>to do this.  (See <a href="faq.html#turn-off-unicode">this FAQ question</a>.)

<h2>Use of minisat SAT solver</h2>

<p> On some Windows systems, the automatic use of the <code>minisat</code> solver causes serious slowdowns as <code>hol</code> starts up.
For this reason, it has been disabled by default in the self-installing executable.
It can be re-enabled by renaming the file <code>src/HolSat/sat_solvers/minisat/minisat.tmp.exe</code> to <code>src/HolSat/sat_solvers/minisat/minisat.exe</code>.
