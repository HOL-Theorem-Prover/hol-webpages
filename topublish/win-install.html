<h1>The Windows Installer for HOL</h1>

<dl>
  <dt> <em>System requirements:</em>

  <dd> Windows NT, Windows 2000 or Windows XP.  In addition to the
  space required to store the installer executable (25MB), you will
  need approximately 180 MB of disk-space.

  <dt> <em>Using the installer:</em>
  <dd>
      <ul>
        <li> <p> You <strong>must</strong> have MoscowML 2.01 installed
            before you running the installer.  In particular, this
            means that the environment variables <code>PATH</code> and
            <code>MOSMLLIB</code> must be correctly set.  Further, these
	    variables must be Windows environment variables (set through 
	    the Control Panel).  It is not enough to have variables set just 
	    for Cygwin shells.</p>

	    <p> The <a
	    href="http://www.dina.dk/~sestoft/mosml/mosml-2.01-1.exe">self-extracting
	    installer</a> for Moscow&nbsp;ML will normally set
	    environment variables correctly as part of its
	    installation process.</p>

        <li> When Moscow ML is installed, you can install HOL by
            running the installer executable.  It will prompt you for
            the directory to install in.
        <li> At the very end of the process, a DOS-like window will
            appear, and the system will attempt to configure itself.
            This process also involves the creation of many help
            files, and can take a little while.  If this window
            disappears almost instantly or with an error message, you
            probably haven't installed Moscow ML correctly.  (See 
	    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=6455&amp;group_id=31790">here</a> 
	    for more details.)
      </ul>
