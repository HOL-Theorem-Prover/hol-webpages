<h1>The Windows Installer for HOL</h1>

<dl>
  <dt> <em>System requirements:</em>

  <dd> Windows&nbsp;NT, Windows&nbsp;2000, Windows&nbsp;XP, Windows&nbsp;Vista, or Windows&nbsp;7.
    We assume Windows&nbsp;8 will work as well.
    In addition to the space required to store the installer executable (35MB), you will need approximately 300 MB of disk-space.

  <dt> <em>Using the installer:</em>
  <dd>
      <ul>
        <li> <p> You <strong>must</strong> have MoscowML&nbsp;2.01 installed before you running the installer.
            In particular, this means that the environment variables <code>PATH</code> and <code>MOSMLLIB</code> must be correctly set.
            Further, these variables must be Windows environment variables (set through the Control Panel).
            It is not enough to have variables set just for Cygwin shells.</p>

	    <p> The <a href="http://www.itu.dk/~sestoft/mosml/mosml-2.01-1.exe">self-extracting installer</a> for Moscow&nbsp;ML will normally set environment variables correctly as part of its installation process.</p>

            <p> For Kananaskis-10 and earlier, the Moscow&nbsp;ML installer for 2.10 is not compatible with the HOL4 installer; you must use the older installer for Moscow&nbsp;2.01.

        <li> <p>When Moscow ML is installed, you can install HOL by
            running the installer executable.  It will prompt you for
            the directory to install in.</p>

        <li> <p>Note that both the Moscow&nbsp;ML and HOL installers require the user to have administrative privileges.

        <li> <p>At the very end of the process, a DOS-like window will
            appear, and the system will attempt to configure itself.
            This process also involves the creation of many help
            files, and can take a little while.  If this window
            disappears almost instantly or with an error message, you
            probably haven’t installed Moscow ML correctly.  (See
	    <a href="win-details.html">here</a>
	    for more details.)</p>
      </ul>

  available, and highly recommended, <a

<h2>Unicode, UTF-8 and HOL4 on Windows</h2>

<p> A new trace variable <code>PP.avoid_unicode</code> is set to true (strictly, <code>1</code>) on Windows by default.
This prevents the appearance of “gibberish” in the standard “MS-DOS” <code>command.com</code> shell.
If you are running within <code>emacs</code> or some other setting where UTF-8 characters will work, you can set this trace variable to <code>0</code>:
<pre>
       set_trace "PP.avoid_unicode" 0;
</pre>
<p> to get back the nice Unicode output.
Note that Unicode input in UTF-8 will continue to work regardless.
(See also <a href="faq.html#turn-off-unicode">this FAQ question</a>.)

<h2>Use of minisat SAT solver</h2>

<p> On some Windows systems, the automatic use of the <code>minisat</code> solver causes serious slowdowns as <code>hol</code> starts up.
For this reason, it has been disabled by default in the self-installing executable.
It can be re-enabled by renaming the file <code>src/HolSat/sat_solvers/minisat/DELTHISminisat.exe</code> to <code>src/HolSat/sat_solvers/minisat/minisat.exe</code>.
