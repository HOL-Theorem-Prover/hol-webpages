<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">When applied to a theorem-tactic and a goal, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">POP_ASSUM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> applies
the theorem-tactic to the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ASSUME</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">d first element of the assumption list,
and applies the resulting tactic to the goal without the first
assumption in its assumption list:

<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">COMMENTS</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">It is possible simply to use the theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ASSUME&nbsp;A1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> as required rather than
use </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">POP_ASSUM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">; this will also maintain </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the assumption list,
which is generally useful. In addition, this approach can equally well be
applied to assumptions other than the first.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">There are admittedly times when </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">POP_ASSUM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is convenient, but it is most
unwise to use it if there is more than one assumption in the assumption
list, since this introduces a dependency on the ordering, which is vulnerable
to changes in the HOL system.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Another point to consider is that if the relevant assumption has been obtained
by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">DISCH_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, it is often cleaner to use </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">DISCH_THEN</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> with a theorem-tactic.
For example, instead of:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   DISCH_TAC THEN POP_ASSUM (fn th =&gt; SUBST1_TAC (SYM th))
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
one might use
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   DISCH_THEN (SUBST1_TAC o SYM)
