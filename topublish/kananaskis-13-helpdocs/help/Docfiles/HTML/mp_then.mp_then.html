<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">mp_then</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> tactic combines two theorems (one or both of which will
typically come from the current goal&rsquo;s assumptions) using modus ponens
in a controlled way, and then passes the result of this to a
continuation theorem-tactic.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Thus </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">mp_then&nbsp;ttac&nbsp;pos&nbsp;ith&nbsp;th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a tactic in the usual &ldquo;</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">_then</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">&rdquo;
fashion which produces a theorem and then applies the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ttac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
continuation to that result. The theorems </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ith</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are the two
theorems: </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ith</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> contains the implication, and the other has a
conclusion matching one of the antecedents of the implication.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">An implication&rsquo;s antecedents are calculated by first normalising the implication so that it is of the form

<SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pos</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> parameter indicates how to find the antecedent. There are
four possible forms for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pos</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (constructors for the type
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">mp_then.match_position</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">). It can be </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Any</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, which tells </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">mp_then</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to
search for anything that works. It can be </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Pat&nbsp;q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> a
quotation, which means to find anything matching </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> that works. It
can be </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Pos&nbsp;f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, where </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a function of type </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">term&nbsp;list&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;term</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">,
and is typically a value such as </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">hd</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">el&nbsp;n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> for some number </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> or
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">last</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. This function is passed the list of all </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ith</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">&rsquo;s antecedents to
pick the right one. Finally, the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pos</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> parameter might be </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Concl</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">,
meaning that the conclusion of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ith</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is treated as a negated
assumption. This allows implications to be used in a contrapositive
way.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">In practice, there are some common patterns for obtaining </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ith</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. Apart from the fully applied version above, you might also see:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   &lt;sel&gt;_assum (mp_then pos ttac ith)

   &lt;sel&gt;_assum (&lt;sel&gt;_assum o mp_then pos ttac)

   disch_then(&lt;sel&gt;_assum o mp_then pos ttac)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
where </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&lt;sel&gt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is one of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">first</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">last</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">qpat</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">goal</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, possibly
with an appended </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">_x</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">; the usual ways of obtaining theorems from the
current goal. Where there are two selectors used, the outermost is
used for the selection of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and the innermost selects the
implicational theorem. In the first example, the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ith</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> value is
provided in the call, and is presumably an existing theorem rather
than an assumption from the goal.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">goal_assum</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> selector is worth special mention since it&rsquo;s
especially useful with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">mp_then</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">: it turns an existentially quantified
goal </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">?x.&nbsp;P&nbsp;x</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> into the assumption </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">!x.&nbsp;P&nbsp;x&nbsp;==&gt;&nbsp;F</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> thereby providing a
theorem with antecedents to match on. In conjunction with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">mp_then</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> it
has the effect of instantiating the existential quantifier in order to
match a provided subterm (similar to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">part_match_exists_tac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> or
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">asm_exists_tac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">).</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Finally, note that the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Pat</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Any</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> position selectors will
backtrack across the set of theorem antecedents to find a match that
makes the whole application succeed.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">If the provided implicational theorem doesn&rsquo;t have a match at a
compatible position for the second provided theorem, or if no such
match then allows the continuation </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ttac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to succeed.</SPAN>
