<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">EVERY_CONJ_CONV&nbsp;c&nbsp;t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> takes the conversion </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">c</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and applies
this to every top-level conjunct within term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  A top-level
conjunct is a sub-term that can be reached from the root of the term
by breaking apart only conjunctions.  The terms affected by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">c</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are
those that would be returned by a call to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">strip_conj&nbsp;c</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  In
particular, if the term as a whole is not a conjunction, then the
conversion will be applied to the whole term.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If the result of the application of the conversion to one of the
conjuncts is one of the constants true or false, then one of two
standard rewrites is applied, simplifying the resulting term.  If one
of the conjuncts is converted to false, then the conversion will not be
applied to the remaining conjuncts (the conjuncts are worked on from
left to right), and the result of the whole application will simply be
false.  Alternatively, conjuncts that are converted to true will not
appear in the final result at all.</SPAN>
