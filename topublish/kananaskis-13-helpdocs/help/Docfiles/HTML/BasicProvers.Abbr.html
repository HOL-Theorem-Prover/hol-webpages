<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Abbr</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> function is used to signal to various simplification
tactics that an abbreviation in the current goal should be eliminated
before simplification proceeds.  Each theorem created by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Abbr</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is
removed from the tactic&rsquo;s theorem-list argument, and causes a call to
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q.UNABBREV_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> with that </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Abbr</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> theorem&rsquo;s argument.  Finally, the
simplification tactic continues, with the rest of the theorem-list as
its argument.  Thus,
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>

Every theorem created by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Abbr</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the argument list is treated in
