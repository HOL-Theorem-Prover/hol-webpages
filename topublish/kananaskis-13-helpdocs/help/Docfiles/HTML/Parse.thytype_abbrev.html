<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">A call to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thytype_abbrev({Name=n,Thy=t},&nbsp;ty,&nbsp;prp)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> establishes the
&ldquo;kernel&rdquo; name </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t$n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> as an abbreviation for the type </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ty</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, as happens
with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">type_abbrev</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The boolean flag </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">prp</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> indicates whether or not
this abbreviation will also be used when the printer comes to print
the given type. In other words, after the call it becomes possible to
write </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">``:args&nbsp;t$n``</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to stand for type </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ty</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. If there are type
variables in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ty</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> they become the parameters to the new abbreviated
type operator. These parameters need to be filled in in the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">args</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
position above. If there are no type variables in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ty</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> then
abbreviation is of a whole type, and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">args</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> must be blank.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If there was an existing abbreviation for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t$n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, then this will be
replaced by the call.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">In addition, after the given call, this abbreviation will become the
preferred binding for the bare name </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. Other abbreviations in
different theories will need to use the form with fully-qualified
names (</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thy1$n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thy2$n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> etc).</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If the boolean flag is false, this invocation is comparable to the
behaviour after </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">intputonly_type_abbrev</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">: the abbreviation can be used
to input types of the desired pattern, but such types will print as
they did previously.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">As with other parsing and pretty-printing functions, there is a
companion function, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">temp_thytype_abbrev</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, which has the same effect
on the global grammar but does not cause the change to persist when
the theory is exported.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">It is legitimate to use a string for the theory component of the
record that does not correspond to the current theory. Indeed, it is
perfectly reasonable to do this, if one wants to give priority to a
particular ancestral abbreviation.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
