<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Although normally used to sequence tactics which generate a single subgoal,
it is worth remembering that it is sometimes useful to apply the same tactic
to multiple subgoals; sequences like the following:

   EQ_TAC THENL [ASM_REWRITE_TAC[], ASM_REWRITE_TAC[]]
</pre></DIV>
