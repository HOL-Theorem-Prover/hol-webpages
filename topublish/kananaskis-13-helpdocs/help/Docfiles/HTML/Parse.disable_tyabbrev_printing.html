<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">COMMENTS</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">When a type-abbreviation is established with the function
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">type_abbrev</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, this alters both parsing and printing: when the new
abbreviation appears in input the type parser will translate away the
abbreviation.  Similarly, when an instance of the abbreviation appears
in a type that the printer is to output, it will replace the instance
with the abbreviation.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">This is generally the appropriate behaviour.  However, there is are a
number of useful abbreviations where reversing parsing when printing
is not so useful.  For example, the abbreviation mapping </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">'a&nbsp;set</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">'a&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;bool</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is convenient, but it would be a mistake having it print
because types such as that of conjunction would print as
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   (/\) : bool -&gt; bool set
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
which is rather confusing.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">As with other printing and parsing functions, there is a version of
this function, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">temp_disable_tyabbrev_printing</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> that does not cause
its effect to persist with an exported theory.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
