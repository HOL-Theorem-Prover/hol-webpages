matching in the sense of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ho_match_term</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. Free variables in the

<SPAN class = "TEXT">
searches the assumptions for an equality over numbers and
causes its right hand side to be substituted for its left hand side
throughout the goal and assumptions.  It also removes the equality
from the assumption list.  Trying to use </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">FIRST_ASSUM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> above (i.e.,
replacing </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">PAT_ASSUM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">FIRST_ASSUM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and dropping the term
argument entirely) would require that the desired equality was the first
such on the list of assumptions.</SPAN>

<SPAN class = "TEXT">If one is trying to solve the goal

<SPAN class = "TEXT">
rewriting with the assumptions directly will cause a loop.
Instead, one might want to rewrite with the formula for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  This can
be done in an assumption-order-independent way with
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   PAT_ASSUM (Term`!x. f x = f' x`) (fn th =&gt; REWRITE_TAC [th])
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
This use of the tactic exploits higher order matching to match the RHS
of the assumption, and the fact that </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is effectively a local
constant in the goal to find the correct assumption.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The behavior of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">PAT_ASSUM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> changed in Kananaskis 12. The old </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">PAT_ASSUM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
(and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">qpat_assum</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q.PAT_ASSUM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) was changed to include an extra </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">_X_</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (or
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">_x_</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">), indicating that the matching assumption is pulled out of the
assumption list. The old name now provides a version that doesn&rsquo;t pull
the assumption out of the list.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
