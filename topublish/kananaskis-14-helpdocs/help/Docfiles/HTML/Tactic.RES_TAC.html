<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> searches for pairs of assumed assumptions of a goal (that is, for a
candidate implication and a candidate antecedent, respectively) which can be
&lsquo;resolved&rsquo; to yield new results. The conclusions of all the new results are
returned as additional assumptions of the subgoal(s).  The effect of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
on a goal is to enrich the assumptions set with some of its collective
consequences.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">When applied to a goal </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A&nbsp;?-&nbsp;g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> uses </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_CANON</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to
obtain a set of implicative theorems in canonical form from the assumptions </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
of the goal. Each of the resulting theorems (if there are any) will have the
form:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   A |- u1 ==&gt; u2 ==&gt; ... ==&gt; un ==&gt; v
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> then tries to repeatedly &lsquo;resolve&rsquo; these theorems
against the assumptions of a goal by attempting to match the antecedents </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">u1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">,
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">u2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">un</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (in that order) to some assumption of the goal (i.e. to some
candidate antecedents among the assumptions).  If all the antecedents can be
matched to assumptions of the goal, then an instance of the theorem
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   A u {a1,...,an} |- v
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
called a &lsquo;final resolvent&rsquo; is obtained by repeated specialization of
the variables in the implicative theorem, type instantiation, and applications
of modus ponens.  If only the first </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">i</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> antecedents </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">u1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ui</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> can be
matched to assumptions and then no further matching is possible, then the final
resolvent is an instance of the theorem:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   A u {a1,...,ai} |- u(i+1) ==&gt; ... ==&gt; v
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
All the final resolvents obtained in this way (there may be several,
since an antecedent </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ui</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> may match several assumptions) are added to the
assumptions of the goal, in the stripped form produced by using
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">STRIP_ASSUME_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  If the conclusion of any final resolvent is a
contradiction &lsquo;</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">F</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">&rsquo; or is alpha-equivalent to the conclusion of the goal, then
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> solves the goal.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

since the final resolvents added to the original assumptions are never used as
&lsquo;candidate antecedents&rsquo; it is sometimes necessary to apply </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> more than
