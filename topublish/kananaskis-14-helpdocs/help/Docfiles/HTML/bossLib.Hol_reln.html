<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Hol_reln</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> function is used to define inductively characterised
relations.  It takes a term quotation as input and attempts to define
the relations there specified.  The input term quotation must parse to
a term that conforms to the following grammar:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   &lt;input-format&gt; ::= &lt;clause&gt; /\ &lt;input-format&gt; | &lt;clause&gt;
   &lt;clause&gt;       ::= (!x1 .. xn. &lt;hypothesis&gt; ==&gt; &lt;conclusion&gt;)
                   |  (!x1 .. xn. &lt;conclusion&gt;)
   &lt;conclusion&gt;   ::= &lt;con&gt; sv1 sv2 ....
   &lt;hypothesis&gt;   ::= any term
   &lt;con&gt;          ::= a new relation constant
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">sv1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> terms that appear after a constant name are
so-called "schematic variables".  The same variables must always
follow the same constant name throughout the definition.  These
variables and the names of the constants-to-be must not be quantified
over in each </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&lt;clause&gt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  Otherwise, a </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&lt;clause&gt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> must not include any
free variables.  (The universal quantifiers at the head of the clause
can be used to bind free variables, but it is also permissible to use
existential quantification in the hypotheses.  If a clause has no free
variables, it is permissible to have no universal quantification.)</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Hol_reln</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> function may be used to define multiple relations.
These may or may not be mutually recursive.  The clauses for each
relation need not be contiguous.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The function returns three theorems.  Each is also saved in the
current theory segment.  The first is a conjunction of implications
that will be the same as the input term quotation.  This theorem is

first relation defined by the function.  The second is the induction
principle for the relations, saved under the name </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&lt;stem&gt;_ind</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  The
third is the cases theorem for the relations, saved under the name
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&lt;stem&gt;_cases</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  The cases theorem is of the form

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Hol_reln</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> function will fail if the provided quotation does not
parse to a term of the specified form.  It will also fail if a
clause&rsquo;s only free variables do not follow a relation name, or if a
relation name is followed by differing schematic variables.  If the
definition principle can not prove that the characterisation is
inductive (as would happen if a hypothesis included a negated
occurence of one of the relation names), then the same theorems are
returned, but with extra assumptions stating the required inductive
property.</SPAN>
