<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Rewrites a goal using implications of equalites, adding proof obligations as required.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">In a call </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">DEP_REWRITE_TAC&nbsp;[thm1,...]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">,
the argument theorems </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thm1,...</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are typically implications.
The tactic identifies the consequents of the argument theorems,
and attempt to match these against the current goal.  If a match
is found, the goal is rewritten according to the matched instance
of the consequent, after which the corresponding hypotheses of
the argument theorems are added to the goal as new conjuncts on
the left.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Care needs to be taken that the implications will match the goal
properly, that is, instances where the hypotheses in fact can be
proven.  Also, even more commonly than with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWRITE_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">,
the rewriting process may diverge.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Each implication theorem for rewriting may have a number of layers
of universal quantification and implications.  At the bottom of
these layers is the base, which will either be an equality, a
negation, or a general term.  The pattern for matching will be
the left-hand-side of an equality, the term negated of a negation,
or the term itself in the third case.  The search is top-to-bottom
left-to-right, depending on the quantifications of variables.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">To assist in focusing the matching to useful cases, the goal is
searched for a subterm matching the pattern.  The matching of the
pattern to subterms is performed by higher-order matching, so for
example, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">!x.&nbsp;P&nbsp;x</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will match the term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">!n.&nbsp;(n+m)&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;4*n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The argument theorems may each be either an implication or not.
For those which are implications, the hypotheses of the instance
of each theorem which matched the goal are added to the goal as
conjuncts on the left side.  For those argument theorems which
are not implications, the goal is simply rewritten with them.
This rewriting is also higher order.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Deep inner universal quantifications of consequents are supported.
Thus, an argument theorem like </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">EQ_LIST</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">:

<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">As much as possible, the newly added hypotheses are analyzed to
remove duplicates; thus, several theorems with the same
hypothesis, or several uses of the same theorem, will generate
a minimal additional proof burden.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The new hypotheses are added as conjuncts rather than as a
separate subgoal to reduce the user&rsquo;s burden of subgoal splits
when creating tactics to prove theorems.  If a separate subgoal
is desired, simply use </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">CONJ_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> after the dependent rewriting to
split the goal into two, where the first contains the hypotheses
and the second contains the rewritten version of the original
goal.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
