<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">expandf</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a faster version of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">expand</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. It does not use a
validated version of the tactic. That is, no check is made that the
justification of the tactic does prove the goal from the subgoals it generates.
If an invalid tactic is used, the theorem ultimately proved  may not match the
goal originally set. Alternatively, failure may occur when the justifications
are applied in which case the theorem would not be proved. For a description of
the subgoal package, see under </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">set_goal</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Calling </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">expandf&nbsp;tac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails if the tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails for the top goal. It will
diverge if the tactic diverges for the goal. It will fail if there are no
unproven goals. This could be because no goal has been set using </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">set_goal</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> or
because the last goal set has been completely proved. If an invalid tactic,
whose justification actually fails, has been used earlier in the proof,
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">expandf&nbsp;tac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> may succeed in applying </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and apparently prove the current
goal. It may then fail as it applies the justifications of the tactics applied
earlier.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

The following example shows how the use of an invalid tactic can
yield a  theorem which does not correspond to the  goal set.

The proof assumed something which was not on the assumption list.
This assumption appears in the assumption list of the theorem proved, even
though it was not in the goal. An attempt to perform the proof using </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">expand</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
fails. The validated version of the tactic detects that the justification
produces a theorem which does not correspond to the goal set. It therefore
fails.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
