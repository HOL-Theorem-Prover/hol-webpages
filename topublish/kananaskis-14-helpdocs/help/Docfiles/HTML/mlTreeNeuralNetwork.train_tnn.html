The term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is expected to be lambda-free with each operator appearing with a 
unique arity. The list </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">l</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is expected to be a list of real numbers between 0 and 
1. In the case of a simple objective each example </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(t,l)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is to be written as 
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">[(h(t),l)]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> where </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">h</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a variable representing the head network. For multiple 
objectives, one can write </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">[(h1(t),l1),...,(hn(t),ln)]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> for a single example.
The created list of examples is to be split into a training set and a test set (possibly empty).</SPAN></DIV></DD>
