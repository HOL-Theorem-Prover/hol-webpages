<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Renames free variables or subterms within a goal.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">A call to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RENAME_TAC&nbsp;qs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> searches the current goal for matches to the
patterns in the list </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">qs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, and then substitutes out the matches (in
the &ldquo;reverse direction&rdquo;) so that the goal becomes one that uses the
names from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">qs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. This can cause subterms within the goal to turn into
simple variables, but the usual intention is to rename free variables
into the variables that appear in the patterns.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The matching is done without reference to the goal&rsquo;s existing free
variables. If a variable in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">qs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> clashes with an existing variable in
the goal, then the goal&rsquo;s variable will be renamed away. It is
sufficient for variables to have the same name to &ldquo;clash&rdquo;; they need
not also have the same type. The search for matches begins by
attempting to find matches against the whole of the goal, against
whole assumptions, for sub-terms within the goal, and then sub-terms
of assumptions. If multiple matches are possible, a variant tactic,
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q.kRENAME_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, can be used: this tactic takes an additional
&ldquo;continuation&rdquo; tactic argument that can be used to discriminate
between these matches.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Patterns can use underscores to match anything without any change in
the goal&rsquo;s naming being introduced. Underscores can match against
sub-terms that include bound variables. Matching is first-order.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Fails if it is impossible to consistently match the combination of

<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">If the goal is of the form
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   x &lt; y, y &lt; z ?- x &lt; f a
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
then invoking </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q.RENAME_TAC&nbsp;[`b&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;c`,&nbsp;`a&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;b`]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will produce the sub-goal:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   a &lt; b, b &lt; c ?- a &lt; f a'
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
where the goal&rsquo;s original </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">a</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> variable (which is not even of type
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">num</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">), has been renamed away from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">a</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> because that variable occurs in the
patterns. (If the right hand side of the inequality was simply </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">a</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and
was thus of type num, it would also be renamed to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">a'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.)</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q.RENAME_TAC&nbsp;[`b&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;c`]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is invoked on the same initial goal, the result is:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   b &lt; y, y &lt; z ?- b &lt; c
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
illustrating the way in which variables can eliminate more complicated sub-terms.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The useful way in which underscores in patterns can be used to &ldquo;dodge&rdquo; terms including bound variables is illustrated in the next example, where the initial goal is:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   (!a. f a &lt; z), z &lt; c ?- z &lt; d
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
After applying </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q.RENAME_TAC&nbsp;[`_&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;x`,&nbsp;`x&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;c`]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the goal becomes
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   (!a. f a &lt; x), x &lt; c' ?- x &lt; c
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The goal was chosen for the match to the second pattern because the goal is considered first. If the initial goal had been
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   (!a. f a &lt; z), z &lt; c ?- z &lt; d /\ P z
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
then the result of the same application would be
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   (!a. f a &lt; z), z &lt; c ?- x &lt; d /\ P x
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
because whole assumptions are considered before sub-terms of the goal.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Note that </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q.RENAME_TAC&nbsp;[q]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is </SPAN><em>not</em><SPAN class = "TEXT"> the same as </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q.RENAME1_TAC&nbsp;q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.
The latter pays attention to the goal&rsquo;s free variables, using these to
constrain the match to the pattern. In contrast, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q.RENAME_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
completely ignores all of the goal&rsquo;s free variables, such that using
an existing name in a pattern doesn&rsquo;t make any difference to the
matching behaviour.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
