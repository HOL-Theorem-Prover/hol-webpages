<SPAN class = "TEXT">If the given </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ld</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">-</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">rd</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> pair is already associated with an injector,

overloading resolution method. In particular, note that the standard
double quotation mark (ASCII character 34, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">"</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) is associated with the
&ldquo;null&rdquo; injector, which takes string literals into the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">string</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> type.
Other injectors can be associated with this delimiter pair.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The other valid delimiter pairs are double guillemets (</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">«...»</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, U+00AB

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">This facility is analogous to the way in which numerals can be seen to
