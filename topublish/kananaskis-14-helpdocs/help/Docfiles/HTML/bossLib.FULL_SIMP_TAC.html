<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">FULL_SIMP_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a powerful simplification tactic that simplifies
all of a goal.  It proceeds by applying simplification to each
assumption of the goal in turn, accumulating simplified assumptions as
it goes.  These simplified assumptions are used to simplify further
assumptions, and all of the simplified assumptions are used as
additional rewrites when the conclusion of the goal is simplified.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">In addition, simplified assumptions are added back onto the goal using
the equivalent of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">STRIP_ASSUME_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and this causes automatic
skolemization of existential assumptions, case splits on disjunctions,
and the separate assumption of conjunctions.  If an assumption is
simplified to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">TRUTH</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, then this is left on the assumption list.  If
an assumption is simplified to falsity, this proves the goal.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The application of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">STRIP_ASSUME_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to simplified
assumptions means that </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">FULL_SIMP_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> can cause unwanted case-splits
and other undesirable transformations to occur in one&rsquo;s assumption
list.  If one wants to apply the simplifier to assumptions without
this occurring, the best approach seems to be the use of
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RULE_ASSUM_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">SIMP_RULE</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Each assumption is used to rewrite lower-numbered assumptions.
To get the opposite effect, where
each assumption is used to rewrite higher-numbered assumptions,
use </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REV_FULL_SIMP_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
