<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">This function implements selective rewriting with a subset of the assumptions
of the theorem. The first argument (a predicate on terms) is applied to all
assumptions, and the ones which return </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">true</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are used to rewrite the goal.

Using </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> may result in a diverging sequence of
rewrites. In such cases </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">FILTER_PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> may be used.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">USES</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">This rule can be applied when rewriting with all assumptions results in
divergence. Typically, the predicate can model checks as to whether a certain
variable appears on the left-hand side of an equational assumption, or whether
the assumption is in disjunctive form.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Another use is to improve performance when there are many assumptions
which are not applicable. Rewriting, though a powerful method of
proving theorems in HOL, can result in a reduced performance due to
the pattern matching and the number of primitive inferences involved.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
