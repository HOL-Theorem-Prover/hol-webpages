<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">An invocation </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">delete_const&nbsp;s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> removes the constant denoted by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
from the current HOL segment. All types, terms, and theorems that 
depend on that constant become garbage.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The implementation ensures that a deleted constant is never equal 
to a subsequently declared constant, even if it has the same name and type.
Furthermore, although garbage types, terms, and theorems may exist in 
a session, and may even have been stored in the current segment for
export, no theorem, definition, or axiom that is garbage is exported
when </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">export_theory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is invoked. </SPAN>

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">A type, term, or theorem that depends on a deleted constant may be 
detected by invoking the appropriate &lsquo;uptodate&rsquo; entrypoint.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">It may happen that a theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is proved with the use of another
theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> that subsequently becomes garbage because a 
constant </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">c</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> was deleted. If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">c</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> does not occur in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, then </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> does
not become garbage, which may be contrary to expectation. The conservative
extension property of HOL says that </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is still provable, even in
the absence of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">c</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
