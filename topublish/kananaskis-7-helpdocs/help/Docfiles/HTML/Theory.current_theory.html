<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Returns the name of the current theory segment.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">A HOL session has a notion of &lsquo;current theory&rsquo;. There are two senses to
this phrase. First, the current theory denotes the totality of all
loaded theories plus whatever definitions, axioms, and theorems have 
been stored in the current session.  In this sense, the current theory
is the full logical context being used at the moment. This logical context
can be extended in two ways: (a) by loading in prebuilt theories
residing on disk; and (b) by making a definition, asserting an axiom,
or storing a theorem. Therefore, the current theory consists of a body 
of prebuilt theories that have been loaded from disk 
(a collection of static components) plus whatever has been stored 
in the current session. </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">This latter component --- what has been stored in the current session
--- embodies the second sense of &lsquo;current theory&rsquo;. 
It is more properly known as the &lsquo;current theory segment&rsquo;. The current
segment is dynamic in nature, for its contents can be augmented and 
overwritten. It functions as a kind of scratchpad used to help build
a static theory segment.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">In a HOL session, there is always a single current theory segment. Its
name is given by calling </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">current_theory()</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. On startup, the current theory
segment is called </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">"scratch"</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, which is just a default name. If one is 
just experimenting, or hacking about, then this segment can be used.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">On the other hand, if one intends to build a static theory segment, 
one usually creates a new theory segment named </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thy</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> by calling 
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_theory&nbsp;thy</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. This changes the value of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">current_theory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thy</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.
Once such a theory segment has been built (which may take many
sessions), one calls </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">export_theory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, which exports the stored elements
to disk.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
