<h1>Downloading HOL4 Sources with Subversion (Anonymously)</h1>

<p>The first thing you need to do is check out a copy of
the HOL repository from SourceForge.  This is
easy!  There’s just one step:
<pre>
   svn co https://hol.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/hol/HOL
</pre>

<p> This will download a complete copy of all the current sources and
install them in a directory called <tt>HOL</tt>.  This is not the same thing
as the source tree we distribute, but differs only slightly (it has
more stuff).
You will now have a copy of the sources and should be able to build
hol in the normal way:</p>
<pre>
   sml-system &lt; tools/smart-configure.sml
   bin/build
</pre>
<p>(where <code>sml-system</code> is one of <code>mosml</code>
or <code>poly</code>).</p>

<p>The really nice thing about this copy of the sources is that if
there is a check-in changing the sources, you can automatically patch
your copy of the sources to reflect this by typing
<code>svn&nbsp;update</code> in the HOL directory.  Also, the
<code>svn&nbsp;stat</code> command will tell you if you have modified
any of the files in the distribution by listing those files and
printing an <code>M</code> (for ‘modified’) beside them.</p>

<p>You can tell if there’s been a check-in by subscribing to the
<code>hol-checkins</code> mailing list.  Subscribe to this mailing list <a
href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/hol-checkins">here</a>.
You can check the archives for the list (and see what you might be
letting yourself in for) by following the link on the above page.</p>
