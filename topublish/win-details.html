<h1>The Windows Installation of HOL4</h1>

<ul>
<li> <p> We believe that the self-installing Windows binary
     <em>only</em> works under Windows NT or later.  It should be
     possible to build a Windows98 version of HOL from sources.

<li> <p> You must have Moscow ML 2.01 fully installed to build HOL or to run
  the self-installing program.  This includes having the appropriate
  environment variables set (you need both <code>MOSMLLIB</code>, and a new entry
  in <code>PATH</code>).

<li> <p> If running the standard HOL interactive loop, you will not
  be able to exit from the interactive program with <code>quit</code>.
  Instead, you will have to type the eof
  combination <code>&lt;Control&gt;-Z&nbsp;&lt;RET&gt;</code>.

<li> <p> The very last stage of the installation process is to run a program
  called <code>win-config</code>.  If this doesn’t work for some
  reason (maybe because you haven’t set up the environment variables
  that Moscow&nbsp;ML depends on properly), then you can run it
  yourself to complete the process.  Open up an MS-DOS shell, change
  to the <code>tools</code> directory within the HOL source, and type,
  for example,
<pre>
    win-config "c:\program files\Hol"
</pre>
  <p> where the argument to the command is the path of where HOL was
  installed.
</ul>
