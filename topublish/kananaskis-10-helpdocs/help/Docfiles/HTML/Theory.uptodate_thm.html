<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Operations in the current theory segment of HOL allow one to redefine 
types and constants. This can cause theorems to become invalid. As a
result, HOL has a rudimentary consistency maintenance system built
around the notion of whether type operators and term constants are
"up-to-date".</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">An invocation </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">uptodate_thm&nbsp;th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> should check </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to see if it
has been proved from any out-of-date components. However, HOL does
not currently keep the proofs of theorems, so a simpler approach is 
taken. Instead, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is checked to see if its hypotheses and 
conclusions are up-to-date.</SPAN>

<SPAN class = "TEXT">All items from ancestor theories are fixed, and unable to

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">It may happen that a theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is proved with the use of another
theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> that subsequently becomes garbage because a 
constant </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">c</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> was deleted. If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">c</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> does not occur in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, then </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> does
