<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">This function implements selective rewriting with a subset of the assumptions
of the goal. The first argument (a predicate on terms) is applied to all
assumptions, and the ones which return </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">true</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are used to rewrite the goal.

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> does not fail, but it can result in an invalid
tactic if the rewrite is invalid. This happens when a theorem used for
rewriting has assumptions which are not alpha-convertible to assumptions of
the goal. Using </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> may result in a diverging
sequence of rewrites. In such cases </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">FILTER_PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> may be

<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">USES</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">This tactic can be applied when rewriting with all assumptions results in
divergence, or in an unwanted proof state. Typically, the predicate can model
checks as to whether a certain variable appears on the left-hand side of an
equational assumption, or whether the assumption is in disjunctive form. Thus
it allows choice of assumptions to rewrite with in a position-independent
fashion.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Another use is to improve performance when there are many assumptions
which are not applicable. Rewriting, though a powerful method of
proving theorems in HOL, can result in a reduced performance due to
the pattern matching and the number of primitive inferences involved.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
