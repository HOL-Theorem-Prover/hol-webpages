<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Like the basic resolution function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">IMP_RES_THEN</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the resolution tactic
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_THEN</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> performs a single-step resolution of an implication and the
assumptions of a goal. </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_THEN</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> differs from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">IMP_RES_THEN</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> only in that the
implications used for resolution are taken from the assumptions of the goal
itself, rather than supplied as an argument.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">When applied to a goal </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A&nbsp;?-&nbsp;g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_THEN&nbsp;ttac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> uses </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_CANON</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to
obtain a set of implicative theorems in canonical form from the assumptions </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
of the goal. Each of the resulting theorems (if there are any) will have the
form:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   ai |- !x1...xn. ui ==&gt; vi
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
where </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ai</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is one of the assumptions of the goal. Having obtained
these implications, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_THEN</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> then attempts to match each antecedent </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ui</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to
each assumption </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">aj&nbsp;|-&nbsp;aj</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the assumptions </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  If the antecedent </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ui</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> of
any implication matches the conclusion </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">aj</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> of any assumption, then an instance
of the theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ai,&nbsp;aj&nbsp;|-&nbsp;vi</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, called a &lsquo;resolvent&rsquo;, is obtained by
specialization of the variables </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">xn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and type instantiation,
followed by an application of modus ponens.  There may be more than one
canonical implication derivable from the assumptions of the goal and each
such implication is tried against every assumption, so there may be several
resolvents (or, indeed, none).</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Tactics are produced using the theorem-tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ttac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> from all these resolvents
(failures of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ttac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> at this stage are filtered out) and these tactics are then
applied in an unspecified sequence to the goal.  That is,
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   RES_THEN ttac (A ?- g)

<SPAN class = "TEXT">
has the effect of:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   MAP_EVERY (mapfilter ttac [... ; (ai,aj |- vi) ; ...]) (A ?- g)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
where the theorems </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ai,aj&nbsp;|-&nbsp;vi</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are all the consequences that can be
drawn by a (single) matching modus-ponens inference from the assumptions </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
and the implications derived using </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_CANON</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> from the assumptions.  The
sequence in which the theorems </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ai,aj&nbsp;|-&nbsp;vi</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are generated and the
corresponding tactics applied is unspecified.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Evaluating </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_THEN&nbsp;ttac&nbsp;th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails with &lsquo;</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">no&nbsp;implication</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">&rsquo; if no

Evaluation also fails, with &lsquo;</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">no&nbsp;tactics</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">&rsquo;, if there are resolvents, but for

Finally, failure is propagated if any of the tactics that are produced from the
