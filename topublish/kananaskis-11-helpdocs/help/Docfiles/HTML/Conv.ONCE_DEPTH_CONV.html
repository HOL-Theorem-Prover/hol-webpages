<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The following example shows how </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ONCE_DEPTH_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> applies a conversion to only
the first suitable subterm(s) found in a top-down search:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - ONCE_DEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV (Term `(\x. (\y. y + x) 1) 2`);
   &gt; val it = |- (\x. (\y. y + x)1)2 = (\y. y + 2) 1 : thm
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Here, there are two beta-redexes in the input term. One of these
occurs within the other, so </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">BETA_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is applied only to the outermost one.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Note that the supplied conversion is applied by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ONCE_DEPTH_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to all
independent subterms at which it succeeds.  That is, the conversion is applied
to every suitable subterm not contained in some other subterm for which the
conversions also succeeds, as illustrated by the following example:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - ONCE_DEPTH_CONV numLib.num_CONV (Term `(\x. (\y. y + x) 1) 2`);
   &gt; val it = |- (\x. (\y. y + x)1)2 = (\x. (\y. y + x)(SUC 0))(SUC 1) : thm
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Here </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">num_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is applied to both </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, since neither term
occurs within a larger subterm for which the conversion </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">num_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> succeeds.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">USES</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ONCE_DEPTH_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is frequently used when there is only one subterm to which
the desired conversion applies. This can be much faster than using other
functions that attempt to apply a conversion to all subterms of a term (e.g.
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">DEPTH_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">).  If, for example, the current goal in a goal-directed proof
contains only one beta-redex, and one wishes to apply </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">BETA_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to it, then
the tactic
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   CONV_TAC (ONCE_DEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
may, depending on where the beta-redex occurs, be much faster than
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   CONV_TAC (TOP_DEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ONCE_DEPTH_CONV&nbsp;c</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> may also be used when the supplied conversion </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">c</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> never
fails, in which case using a conversion such as </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">DEPTH_CONV&nbsp;c</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, which
applies </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">c</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> repeatedly would never terminate.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">COMMENTS</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The implementation of this function uses failure to avoid rebuilding
unchanged subterms. That is to say, during execution the exception
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">QConv.UNCHANGED</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> may be generated and later trapped. The behaviour of
the function is dependent on this use of failure. So, if the
conversion given as an argument happens to generate the same
exception, the operation of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ONCE_DEPTH_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will be unpredictable.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
