<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Many formalizations require the definition of new types.  For
example, ML-style datatypes are commonly used to model the abstract
syntax of programming languages and the state-space of elaborate
transition systems.  In HOL, such datatypes (at least, those that are
inductive, or, alternatively, have a model in an initial algebra) may be
specified using the invocation </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Datatype&nbsp;`&lt;spec&gt;`</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, where
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&lt;spec&gt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> should conform to the following grammar:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   spec    ::= [ &lt;binding&gt; ; ]* &lt;binding&gt;

   binding ::= &lt;ident&gt; = [ &lt;clause&gt; | ]* &lt;clause&gt;
            |  &lt;ident&gt; = &lt;| [ &lt;ident&gt; : &lt;type&gt; ; ]* &lt;ident&gt; : &lt;type&gt; |&gt;

   clause  ::= &lt;ident&gt; &lt;tyspec&gt;*

   tyspec  ::= ( &lt;type&gt; )
            |  &lt;atomic-type&gt;
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
where </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&lt;atomic-type&gt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a single token denoting a type. For example,
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">num</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">bool</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">'a</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">When a datatype is successfully defined, a number of standard theorems
are automatically proved about the new type: the constructors of the type
are proved to be injective and disjoint, induction and case analysis
theorems are proved, and each type also has a &lsquo;size&rsquo; function defined
for it. All these theorems are stored in the current theory and added to
a database accessed via the functions in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">TypeBase</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The notation used to declare datatypes is, unfortunately, not the same
as that of ML. If anything, the syntax is rather more like Haskell&rsquo;s.
For example, an ML declaration
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   datatype ('a,'b) btree = Leaf of 'a
                          | Node of ('a,'b) btree * 'b * ('a,'b) btree
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
would most likely be declared in HOL as
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   Datatype `btree = Leaf 'a
                   | Node btree 'b btree`
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Note that any type parameters for the new type are not allowed; they
are inferred from the right hand side of the binding. The type
variables in the specification become arguments to the new type
operator in alphabetic order.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">When a record type is defined, the parser is adjusted to allow new
syntax (appropriate for records), and a number of useful
simplification theorems are also proved.  The most useful of the
latter are automatically stored in the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">TypeBase</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and can be inspected
using the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">simpls_of</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> function.  For further details on record types,
see the DESCRIPTION.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">In the following, we shall give an overview of the kinds of types that
may be defined by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Datatype</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">To start, enumerated types can be defined as in the following example:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   Datatype `enum = A1  | A2  | A3  | A4  | A5
                  | A6  | A7  | A8  | A9  | A10
                  | A11 | A12 | A13 | A14 | A15
                  | A16 | A17 | A18 | A19 | A20
                  | A21 | A22 | A23 | A24 | A25
                  | A26 | A27 | A28 | A29 | A30`

</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Other non-recursive types may be defined as well:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   Datatype `foo = N num
                 | B bool
                 | Fn ('a -&gt; 'b)
                 | Pr ('a # 'b`)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Turning to recursive types, we can define a type of binary trees
where the leaves are numbers.
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   Datatype `tree = Leaf num | Node tree tree`
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
We have already seen a type of binary trees having polymorphic values
at internal nodes. This time, we will declare it in &ldquo;paired&rdquo; format.
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
    Datatype `tree = Leaf 'a
                   | Node (tree # 'b # tree)`
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
This specification seems closer to the declaration that one might make
in ML, but is more difficult to deal with in proof than the curried format
used above.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The basic syntax of the named lambda calculus is easy to describe:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
    - load "stringTheory";
    &gt; val it = () : unit

    - Datatype `lambda = Var string
                       | Const 'a
                       | Comb lambda lambda
                       | Abs lambda lambda`
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The syntax for &lsquo;de Bruijn&rsquo; terms is roughly similar:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   Datatype `dB = Var string
                | Const 'a
                | Bound num
                | Comb dB dB
                | Abs dB`
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Arbitrarily branching trees may be defined by allowing a node to hold
the list of its subtrees. In such a case, leaf nodes do not need to be
explicitly declared.
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   Datatype `ntree = Node of 'a (ntree list)`
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
A (tupled) type of &lsquo;first order terms&rsquo; can be declared as follows:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   Datatype `term = Var string
                  | Fnapp (string # term list)`
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Mutally recursive types may also be defined. The following, extracted by
Elsa Gunter from the Definition of Standard ML, captures a subset of
Core ML.
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   Datatype
    `atexp = var_exp string
           | let_exp dec exp ;

       exp = aexp    atexp
           | app_exp exp atexp
           | fn_exp  match ;

     match = match  rule
           | matchl rule match ;

      rule = rule pat exp ;

       dec = val_dec   valbind
           | local_dec dec dec
           | seq_dec   dec dec ;

   valbind = bind  pat exp
           | bindl pat exp valbind
           | rec_bind valbind ;

       pat = wild_pat
           | var_pat string`
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Simple record types may be introduced using the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&lt;|&nbsp;...&nbsp;|&gt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> notation.
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
    Datatype `state = &lt;| Reg1 : num; Reg2 : num; Waiting : bool |&gt;`
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The use of record types may be recursive. For example, the following
declaration could be used to formalize a simple file system.
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   Datatype
     `file = Text string
           | Dir directory
       ;
      directory = &lt;| owner : string ;
                     files : (string # file) list |&gt;`
</pre></DIV>
</DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Now we address some types that cannot be declared with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Datatype</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. In
some cases they cannot exist in HOL at all; in others, the type can be
built in the HOL logic, but </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Datatype</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is not able to make the
definition.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">First, an empty type is not allowed in HOL, so the following attempt
is doomed to fail.
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   Datatype `foo = A foo`
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
So called &lsquo;nested types&rsquo;, which are occasionally quite useful, cannot
at present be built with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Datatype</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   Datatype `btree = Leaf 'a
                   | Node (('a # 'a) btree)`
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Co-algebraic types may not currently be built with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Datatype</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, not
even by attempting to encode the remainder of the list as a function:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   Datatype `lazylist = Nil
                      | Cons ('a # (one -&gt; lazylist))`
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Indeed, this specification corresponds to an algebraic type isomorphic
to &ldquo;standard&rdquo; lists, but </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Datatype</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> rejects it because it cannot
handle recursion to the right of a function arrow. The type of
co-algebraic lists can be built in HOL: see </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">llistTheory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Finally, for cardinality reasons, HOL does not allow the following attempt
to model the untyped lambda calculus as a set (note the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">-&gt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the clause
for the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Abs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> constructor):
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
    Datatype `lambda = Var string
                     | Const 'a
                     | Comb lambda lambda
                     | Abs (lambda -&gt; lambda)`
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Instead, one would have to build a theory of complete partial orders
(or something similar) with which to model the untyped lambda calculus.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">COMMENTS</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The consequences of an invocation of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Datatype</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are stored in the
current theory segment and in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">TypeBase</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The principal consequences
of a datatype definition are the primitive recursion and induction
theorems. These provide the ability to define simple functions over
the type, and an induction principle for the type. For a type named
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ty</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the primitive recursion theorem is stored under </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ty_Axiom</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and
the induction theorem is put under </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ty_induction</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. Other consequences
include the distinctness of constructors (</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ty_distinct</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">), and the
