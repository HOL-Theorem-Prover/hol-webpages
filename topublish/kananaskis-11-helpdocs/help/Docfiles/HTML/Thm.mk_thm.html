<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">mk_thm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> can be used to construct an arbitrary theorem. It is
applied to a pair consisting of the desired assumption list (possibly empty)
and conclusion. All the terms therein should be of type </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">bool</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Although </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">mk_thm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> can be useful for experimentation or temporarily plugging
gaps, its use should be avoided if at all possible in important proofs, because
it can be used to create theorems leading to contradictions. The example above
is a trivial case, but it is all too easy to create a contradiction by
asserting &lsquo;obviously sound&rsquo; theorems.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">All theorems which are likely to be needed can be derived using only HOL&rsquo;s
inbuilt axioms and primitive inference rules, which are provably sound (see
the DESCRIPTION). Basing all proofs, normally via derived rules and tactics, on
just these axioms and inference rules gives proofs which are (apart from bugs
in HOL or the underlying system) completely secure. This is one of the great
strengths of HOL, and it is foolish to sacrifice it to save a little work.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Because of the way tags are propagated during proof, a theorem proved
with the aid of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">mk_thm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is detectable by examining its tag.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
