<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">INDUCT_THEN</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> implements structural induction tactics for
arbitrary concrete recursive types of the kind definable by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">define_type</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  The
first argument to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">INDUCT_THEN</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a structural induction theorem for the
concrete type in question. This theorem must have the form of an induction
theorem of the kind returned by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">prove_induction_thm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. When applied to such a
theorem, the function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">INDUCT_THEN</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> constructs specialized tactic for
doing structural induction on the concrete type in question.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The second argument to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">INDUCT_THEN</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a function that determines what is be
done with the induction hypotheses in the goal-directed proof by structural
induction.  Suppose that </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a structural induction theorem for a concrete
data type </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ty</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, and that </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">A&nbsp;?-&nbsp;!x.P</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a universally-quantified goal in which
the variable </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> ranges over values of type </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ty</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. If the type </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ty</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> has </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
constructors </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">C1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Cn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and &lsquo;</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Ci(vs)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">&rsquo; represents a (curried) application

then </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">INDUCT_THEN&nbsp;th&nbsp;ttac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is an induction tactic that decomposes

The resulting subgoals correspond to the cases in a structural

<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The built-in structural induction theorem for lists is:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   |- !P. P[] /\ (!t. P t ==&gt; (!h. P(CONS h t))) ==&gt; (!l. P l)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
When </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">INDUCT_THEN</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is applied to this theorem, it constructs
and returns a specialized induction tactic (parameterized by a theorem-tactic)
for doing induction on lists:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - val LIST_INDUCT_THEN = INDUCT_THEN listTheory.list_INDUCT;
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The resulting function, when supplied with the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thm_tactic</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ASSUME_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, returns a tactic that decomposes a goal </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">?-&nbsp;!l.P[l]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> into the
base case </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">?-&nbsp;P[NIL]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and a step case </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">P[l]&nbsp;?-&nbsp;!h.&nbsp;P[CONS&nbsp;h&nbsp;l]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, where the
induction hypothesis </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">P[l]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the step case has been put on the assumption
list.  That is, the tactic:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   LIST_INDUCT_THEN ASSUME_TAC
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
does structural induction on lists, putting any induction hypotheses
that arise onto the assumption list:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
                      A ?- !l. P
   =======================================================
    A |- P[NIL/l]   A u {P[l'/l]} ?- !h. P[(CONS h l')/l]
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Likewise </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">LIST_INDUCT_THEN&nbsp;STRIP_ASSUME_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will also do induction
on lists, but will strip induction hypotheses apart before adding them to the
assumptions (this may be useful if P is a conjunction or a disjunction, or is
existentially quantified).  By contrast, the tactic:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   LIST_INDUCT_THEN MP_TAC
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
will decompose the goal as follows:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
                      A ?- !l. P
   =====================================================
    A |- P[NIL/l]   A ?- P[l'/l] ==&gt; !h. P[CONS h l'/l]
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
That is, the induction hypothesis becomes the antecedent of an
implication expressing the step case in the induction, rather than an
assumption of the step-case subgoal.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
