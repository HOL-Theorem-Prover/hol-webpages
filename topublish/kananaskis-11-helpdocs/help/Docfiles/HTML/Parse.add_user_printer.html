<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_user_printer</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is used to add a special purpose term
pretty-printer to the interactive system.  The pretty-printer is
called whenever the term to be printed matches (with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">match_term</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) the
term provided as the second parameter of the triple.  If multiple
calls to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_user_printer</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are made with the same string parameter,
the older functions are replaced entirely.  If multiple printers
match, the more specific match will be chosen.  If two matches are
equally specific, the match chosen is unspecified.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The user-supplied function may choose not to print anything for the

will propagate to the top-level.  If the system printer receives the

The type </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">uprinter</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (standing for "unit printer") is a special monadic
printing type based on the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">smpp</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> module (explained further in the

Thus, when the user&rsquo;s printing function is called, it is passed ten
parameters, including three "gravity" values in a triple, and two
grammars.  The fourth parameter is the system&rsquo;s own printer. The fifth
parameter is a record of functions to call for adding a string to the
output, adding a break, adding new lines, defining some styles for
printing like the color, etc.  The availability of the system&rsquo;s
printer allows the user function to use the default printer on
sub-terms that it is not interested in.  The user function must not
call the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">sysprinter</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> on the term that it is handed initially as the
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">sysprinter</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will immediately call the user printing function all over
again.  If the user printer wants to give the whole term back to the
system printer, then it must use the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">UserPP_Failed</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> exception
described above.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Though there are existing functions </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_string</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_break</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> etc. that
can be used to manipulate pretty-printing streams, users should prefer
instead to use the functions that are provided in the triple with the
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">sysprinter</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. This then gives them access to functions that can
prevent inadvertent symbol merges.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">grav</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> type is used to let pretty-printers know a little about the
context in which a term is to be printed out.  The triple of gravities
is given in the order &ldquo;parent&rdquo;, &ldquo;left&rdquo; and &ldquo;right&rdquo;.  The left
and right gravities specify the precedence of any operator that might
be attempting to &ldquo;grab&rdquo; arguments from the left and right.  For
example, the term
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   (p /\ (if q then r else s)) ==&gt; t
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
should be pretty-printed as
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   p /\ (if q then r else s) ==&gt; t
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The system figures this out when it comes to print the
conditional expression because it knows both that the operator to the
left has the appropriate precedence for conjunction but also that
there is an operator with implication&rsquo;s precedence to the right.  The
issue arises because conjunction is tighter than implication in
precedence, leading the printer to decide that parentheses aren&rsquo;t
necessary around the conjunction.  Similarly, considered on its own,
the conjunction doesn&rsquo;t require parentheses around the conditional
expression because there is no competition between them for
arguments.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">grav</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> constructors </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Top</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RealTop</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> indicate a context
analogous to the top of the term, where there is no binding
competition.  The constructor </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RealTop</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is reserved for situations
where the term really is the top of the tree; </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Top</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is used for
analogous situations such when the term is enclosed in parentheses.
(In the conditional expression above, the printing of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will have
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Top</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> gravities to the left and right.)</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Prec</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> constructor for gravity values takes both a number
indicating precedence level and a string corresponding to the token
that has this precedence level.  This string parameter is of most
importance in the parent gravity (the first component of the triple)
where it can be useful in deciding whether or not to print parentheses
and whether or not to begin fresh pretty-printing blocks.  For
example, tuples in the logic look better if they have parentheses
around the topmost instance of the comma-operator, regardless of
whether or not this is required according to precedence
considerations.  By examining the parent gravity, a printer can
determine more about the term&rsquo;s context.  (Note that the parent
gravity will also be one or other of the left and right gravities; but
it is not possible to tell which.)</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The integer parameter to both the system printing function and the
user printing function is the depth of the term.  The system printer
will stop printing a term if the depth ever reaches exactly zero.
Each time it calls itself recursively, the depth parameter is reduced
by one.  It starts out at the value stored in
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Globals.max_print_depth</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  Setting the latter to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">~1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will ensure
that all of a term is always printed.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Finally, the string parameter to the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_user_printer</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> function is a
string corresponding to the ML function.  Best practice is probably to
define the printing function in an independent structure and to then
have the string be of the form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">"module.fnname"</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  This parameter is
not present in the accompanying </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">temp_add_user_printer</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, as this
latter function does not affect the grammar exported to disk with
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">export_theory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

This example also demonstrates using parent gravities to print out a
big term.  The function passed as an argument to delim is only called
when the parent gravity is not </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">"CONJ"</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  This ensures that the

<SPAN class = "TEXT">A better approach (and certainly a more direct one) would probably be
