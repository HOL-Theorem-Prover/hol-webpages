<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">USES</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">This tactic is useful when the built-in tautologies are not required as
rewrite equations. It is sometimes useful in making more time-efficient
replacements according to equations for which it is clear that no extra
reduction via tautology will be needed. (The difference in efficiency
is only apparent, however, in quite large examples.)</SPAN>
