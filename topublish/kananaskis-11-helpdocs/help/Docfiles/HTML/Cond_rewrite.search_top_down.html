<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">search_top_down&nbsp;tm1&nbsp;tm2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> returns a list of instantiations which make
the whole  or part of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> match </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The first term should not have
a quantifier at the outer most level. </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">search_top_down</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> first
attempts to match the whole second term to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. If this fails, it
recursively descend into the subterms of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to find all matches.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The length of the returned list indicates the number of matches found.
An empty list means no match can be found between </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> or
any subterms of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.
The instantiations returned in the list are in the same format as for  the
function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">match</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. Each instantiation is a pair of lists: the first is
a list of term pairs and the second is a list of type pairs. Either of
these lists may be empty. The situation in which both lists are empty
indicates that there is an exact match between the two terms, i.e., no
instantiation is required to make the entire </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> or a part of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
the same as </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

The first example above shows the entire </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> matching </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.
The second example shows the two terms match exactly. No
instantiation is required. The last example shows that a subterm of
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> can be instantiated to match </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
