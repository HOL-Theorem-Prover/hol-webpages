sub-term of the goal that matches). If a match is found, the goal is
adjusted so that the variables occurring in the pattern now also
appear in the goal. This may rename variables in the goal, or even
cause larger sub-terms to be replaced by variables (as with
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">SPEC_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">). Underscores may be used in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pat</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to indicate &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
