<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Creates a new theory segment.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">A theory consists of a hierarchy of named parts called &lsquo;theory
segments&rsquo;. All theory segments have a &lsquo;theory&rsquo; of the
same name associated with them consisting of the theory segment itself
together with the contents of all its ancestors.  Each axiom,
definition, specification and theorem belongs to a particular
theory segment.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Calling </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_theory&nbsp;thy</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> creates a new, and empty, theory segment
having name </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thy</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The theory segment which was current before the
call becomes a parent of the new theory segment. The new theory
therefore consists of the current theory extended with the new
theory segment. The new theory segment replaces its parent as the
current theory segment. The parent segment is exported to disk.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">In the interests of interactive usability, the behaviour of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_theory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
has some special cases. First, if </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_theory&nbsp;thy</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is called in
a situation where the current theory segment is already called </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thy</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">,
then this is interpreted as the user wanting to restart the current
segment. In that case, the current segment is wiped clean
(types and constants declared in it are removed from the signature, and
all definitions, theorems and axioms are deleted) but is otherwise
unchanged (it keeps the same parents, for example).</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Second, if the current theory segment is empty and named </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">"scratch"</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">,
then </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_theory&nbsp;thy</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> creates a new theory segment the parents of which
are the parents of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">"scratch"</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. (This situation is almost never visible
to users.)</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">A call </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_theory&nbsp;thy</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails if the name </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thy</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is unsuitable for
use as a filename. In particular, it should be an alphanumeric
identifier.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Failure also occurs if </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thy</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is the name of a currently loaded theory
segment. In general, all theory names, whether loaded or not, should be
distinct. Moreover, the names should be distinct even when case
distinctions are ignored.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

Next we make a definition, prove and store a theorem, and
then change our mind about the name of the defined constant. Restarting
the current theory keeps the static theory context fixed but clears
the current segment so that we have a clean slate to work from.
