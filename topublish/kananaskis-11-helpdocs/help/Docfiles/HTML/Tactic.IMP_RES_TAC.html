<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Given a theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the theorem-tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">IMP_RES_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> uses </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_CANON</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to
derive a canonical list of implications, each of which has the form:

<SPAN class = "TEXT">
called a &lsquo;final resolvent&rsquo; is obtained by repeated specialization of
the variables in the implicative theorem, type instantiation, and applications
of modus ponens.  If only the first </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">i</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> antecedents </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">u1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ui</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> can be

</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   A u {a1,...,ai} |- u(i+1) ==&gt; ... ==&gt; v

All the final resolvents obtained in this way (there may be several,
since an antecedent </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ui</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> may match several assumptions) are added to the
assumptions of the goal, in the stripped form produced by using
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">STRIP_ASSUME_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  If the conclusion of any final resolvent is a
contradiction &lsquo;</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">F</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">&rsquo; or is alpha-equivalent to the conclusion of the goal, then
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">IMP_RES_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> solves the goal.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
