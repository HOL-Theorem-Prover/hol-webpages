finds the first </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Ai</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> which matches </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> using higher-order
pattern matching in the sense of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ho_match_term</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  Unless there is just
one match otherwise, free variables in the pattern that are also free
in the assumptions or the goal must not be bound by the match.  In
effect, these variables are being treated as local constants.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

searches the assumptions for an equality over numbers and
causes its right hand side to be substituted for its left hand side
throughout the goal and assumptions.  It also removes the equality
from the assumption list.  Trying to use </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">FIRST_ASSUM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> above (i.e.,
replacing </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">PAT_ASSUM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">FIRST_ASSUM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and dropping the term
argument entirely) would require that the desired equality was the first
such on the list of assumptions, and would leave an equality on the
assumption list of the form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;x</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If one is trying to solve the goal

rewriting with the assumptions directly will cause a loop.
Instead, one might want to rewrite with the formula for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  This can
be done in an assumption-order-independent way with
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   PAT_ASSUM (Term`!x. f x = f' x`) (fn th =&gt; REWRITE_TAC [th])
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
This use of the tactic exploits higher order matching to
match the RHS of the assumption, and the fact that </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is effectively
a local constant in the goal to find the correct assumption.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
