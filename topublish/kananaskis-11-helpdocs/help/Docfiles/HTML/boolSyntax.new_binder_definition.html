<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Defines a new constant, giving it the syntactic status of a binder.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_binder_definition</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> provides a facility for making
definitional extensions to the current theory by introducing a constant
definition.  It takes a pair of arguments, consisting of the name under which
the resulting theorem will be saved in the current theory segment and a term
giving the desired definition.  The value returned by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_binder_definition</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
is a theorem which states the definition requested by the user.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Let </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">vn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> be syntactically distinct tuples constructed from the
variables </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x1,...,xm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  A binder is defined by evaluating
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
new_binder_definition (name, `b v1 ... vn = t`)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
where </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">b</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> does not occur in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, all the free variables that
occur in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are a subset of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x1,...,xn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, and the type
of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">b</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> has the form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(ty1-&gt;ty2)-&gt;ty3</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  This declares </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">b</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to be a new
constant with the syntactic status of a binder in the current theory, and with
the definitional theorem
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   |- !x1...xn. b v1 ... vn = t

<SPAN class = "TEXT">
as its specification.  This constant specification for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">b</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is saved
in the current theory under the name </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">name</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and is returned as a theorem.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The equation supplied to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_binder_definition</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> may optionally have any of its
free variables universally quantified at the outermost level.  The constant </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">b</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
has binder status only after the definition has been made.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_binder_definition</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails if </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> contains free
variables that are not in any one of the variable structures </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">vn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> or
if any variable occurs more than once in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v1,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;v2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  Failure also occurs if
the type of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">b</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is not of the form appropriate for a binder, namely a type of
the form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(ty1-&gt;ty2)-&gt;ty3</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  Finally, failure occurs if there is a type
variable in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">vn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> or </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> that does not occur in the type of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">b</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">It is a common practice among HOL users to write a </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">$</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> before the constant
being defined as a binder to indicate that it will have a special syntactic
status after the definition is made:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
new_binder_definition(name, Term `$b = ... `);
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
This use of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">$</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is not necessary; but after the definition
has been made </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">$</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> must, of course, be used if the syntactic status of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">b</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
needs to be suppressed.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
