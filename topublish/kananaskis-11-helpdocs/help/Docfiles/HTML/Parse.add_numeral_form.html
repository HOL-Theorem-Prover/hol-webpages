<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">This function allows the user to extend HOL&rsquo;s parser and
pretty-printer so that they recognise and print numerals.  A numeral
in this context is a string of digits.  Each such string corresponds
to a natural number (i.e., the HOL type </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">num</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) but </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_numeral_form</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
allows for numerals to stand for values in other types as well.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">A call to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_numeral_form(c,s)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> augments the global term grammar in
two ways.  Firstly, in common with the function
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_bare_numeral_form</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (q.v.), it allows the user to write a single
letter suffix after a numeral (the argument </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">c</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">).  The presence of
this character specifies </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> as the &ldquo;injection function&rdquo; which is to
be applied to the natural number denoted by the preceding digits.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Secondly, the constant denoted by the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> argument is overloaded to be
one of the possible resolutions of an internal, overloaded operator,
which is invisibly wrapped around all numerals that appear without a
character suffix.  After applying </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_numeral_form</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the function
denoted by the argument </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is now a possible resolution of this
overloading, so numerals can now be seen as members of the range of
the type of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Finally, if </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is not </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">NONE</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the constant denoted by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is
overloaded to be one of the possible resolutions of the string </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&amp;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.
This operator is thus the standard way of writing the injection
function from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">:num</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> into other numeric types.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The injection function specifed by argument </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is either the constant
with name </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">s0</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, if </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is of the form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">SOME&nbsp;s0</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, or the identity
function if </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">NONE</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  Using </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_numeral_form</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">NONE</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> for
this parameter is done in the development of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">arithmeticTheory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, and
should not be done subsequently.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Fails if </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">arithmeticTheory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is not loaded, as this is where the basic
constants implementing natural number numerals are defined.  Also
fails if there is no constant with the given name, or if it doesn&rsquo;t
have type </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">:num&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;'a</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> for some </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">'a</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  Fails if
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_bare_numeral_form</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> would also fail on this input.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The natural numbers are given numeral forms as follows:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   val _ = add_numeral_form (#"n", NONE);
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
This is done in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">arithmeticTheory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> so that after it is
loaded, one can write numerals and have them parse (and print) as
natural numbers.  However, later in the development, in
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">integerTheory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, numeral forms for integers are also introduced:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   val _ = add_numeral_form(#"i", SOME "int_of_num");
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Here </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">int_of_num</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is the name of the function which injects
natural numbers into integers.  After this call is made, numeral strings
can be treated as integers or natural numbers, depending on the
context.
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - load "integerTheory";
   &gt; val it = () : unit
   - Term`3`;
   &lt;&lt;HOL message: more than one resolution of overloading was possible.&gt;&gt;
   &gt; val it = `3` : term
   - type_of it;
   &gt; val it = `:int` : hol_type
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The parser has chosen to give the string &ldquo;3&rdquo; integer type
(it will prefer the most recently specified possibility, in common
with overloading in general).  However, numerals can appear with
natural number type in appropriate contexts:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - Term`(SUC 3, 4 + ~x)`;
   &gt; val it = `(SUC 3,4 + ~x)` : term
   - type_of it;
   &gt; val it = `:num # int` : hol_type
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Moreover, one can always use the character suffixes to
absolutely specify the type of the numeral form:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - Term`f 3 /\ p`;
   &lt;&lt;HOL message: more than one resolution of overloading was possible.&gt;&gt;
   &gt; val it = `f 3 /\ p` : term

   - Term`f 3n /\ p`;
   &gt; val it = `f 3 /\ p` : term
</pre></DIV>
