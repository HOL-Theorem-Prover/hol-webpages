<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q.ABBREV_TAC&nbsp;q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> parses the quotation </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the context of
the goal to which it is applied.  The result must be a term of the
form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v&nbsp;=&nbsp;e</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> a variable.  The effect of the tactic is to
replace the term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">e</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> wherever it occurs in the goal by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (or a
primed variant of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> if </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> already occurs in the goal), and to add
the assumption </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Abbrev(v&nbsp;=&nbsp;e)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to the goal&rsquo;s assumptions.  Again, if
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> already occurs free in the goal, then the new assumption will be
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Abbrev(v'&nbsp;=&nbsp;e)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> a suitably primed version of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">It is not an error if the expression </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">e</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> does not occur anywhere
within the goal.  In this situation, the effect of the tactic is
simply to add the assumption </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Abbrev(v&nbsp;=&nbsp;e)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Abbrev</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> constant is defined in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">markerTheory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to be the identity
function over boolean values.  It is used solely as a tag, so that
abbreviations can be found by other tools, and so that simplification
tactics such as </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RW_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will not eliminate them.  When it sees them
as part of its context, the simplifier treats terms of the form
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Abbrev(v&nbsp;=&nbsp;e)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> as assumptions </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">e&nbsp;=&nbsp;v</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  In this way, the simplifier
can use abbreviations to create further sharing, after an
abbreviation&rsquo;s creation.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
