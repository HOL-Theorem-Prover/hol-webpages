<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Include arbitrary ML in exported theory.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">It often happens that algorithms and flag settings accompany a
logical theory (call it </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thy</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">). One would want to simply load the
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thyTheory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> module and have the appropriate proof support, etc.
loaded automatically as well.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">There are several ways to support this. One simple way would be to
define another ML structure, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thySupport</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> say, that depended
on </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thyTheory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The algorithms, etc, could be placed in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thySupport</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
and the interested user would know that by loading </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thySupport</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, its
contents, and those of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thyTheory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, would become available. This
approach, and extensions of it are accomodated already in the
notion of a HOL library.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">However, it is sometimes more appropriate to actually include
the support code directly in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thyTheory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">adjoin_to_theory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
performs this operation.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">A call </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">adjoin_to_theory&nbsp;{sig_ps,&nbsp;struct_ps}</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> adds a signature
prettyprinter </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">sig_ps</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and a structure prettyprinter </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">struct_ps</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to
an internal queue of prettyprinters. When </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">export_theory&nbsp;()</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is
eventually called two things happen: (a) the signature file
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thyTheory.sig</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is written, and (b) the structure file
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thyTheory.sml</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is written. When </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thyTheory.sig</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is written,
each signature prettyprinter in the queue is called, in the order
that they were added to the queue. This printing activity happens
after the rest of the signature (coming from the declarations
in the theory) has been written. Similarly, when </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thyTheory.sml</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
is written, the structure prettyprinters are invoked in queue
order, after the bindings of the theory have been written.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">sig_ps</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">NONE</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, then no signature additions are made.
Likewise, if </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">struct_ps</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">NONE</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, then no structure additions
are made. (This latter possibility doesn&rsquo;t seem to be useful.)</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">It is up to the writer of a prettyprinter to ensure that it
generates valid ML. If a prettyprinter added by a call to
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">adjoin_to_theory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thyTheory.sig</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> or </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">thyTheory.sml</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> could
be malformed, and therefore not properly exported, or compiled.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
