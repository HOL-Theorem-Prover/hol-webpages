<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">A call to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">srw_ss()</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> returns a </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">simpset</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> value that is internally
maintained and updated by the system.  Its value changes as new types
enter the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">TypeBase</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, and as theories are loaded.  For this reason, it
can&rsquo;t be accessed as a simple value, but is instead hidden behind a
function.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The value behind </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">srw_ss()</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> can change in three ways.  Firstly, whenever
a type enters the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">TypeBase</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the type&rsquo;s associated simplification
theorems (accessible directly using the function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">TypeBase.simpls_of</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">)
are all added to the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">simpset</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  This ensures that the "obvious"
rewrite theorems for a type (such as the disjointness of constructors)
need never be explicitly specified.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Secondly, users can interactively add </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">simpset</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fragments to the
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">srw_ss()</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> value by using the function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">augment_srw_ss</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  This
function might be used after a definition is made to ensure that a
particular constant always has its definition expanded.  (Whether or
not a constant warrants this is something that needs to be determined
on a case-by-case basis.)</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Thirdly, theories can augment the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">srw_ss()</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> value as they load.  This
is set up in a theory&rsquo;s script file with the function
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">export_rewrites</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  This causes a list of appropriate theorems to be
added when the theory loads.  It is up to the author of the theory to
ensure that the theorems added to the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">simpset</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are sensible.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
