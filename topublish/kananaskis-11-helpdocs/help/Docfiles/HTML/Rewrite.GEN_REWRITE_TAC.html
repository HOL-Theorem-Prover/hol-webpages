<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Rewrites a goal, selecting terms according to a user-specified strategy.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Distinct rewriting tactics differ in the search strategies used in
finding subterms on which to apply substitutions, and the
built-in theorems used in rewriting. In the case of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWRITE_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">,
this is a recursive traversal starting from the body of the goal&rsquo;s
conclusion part, while in the case of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ONCE_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, for example,
the search stops as soon as a term on which a substitution is possible
is found. </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">GEN_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> allows a user to specify a more complex
strategy for rewriting.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The basis of pattern-matching for rewriting is the notion of
conversions, through the application of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  Conversions
are rules for mapping terms with theorems equating the given terms to
other semantically equivalent ones.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">When attempting to rewrite subterms recursively, the use of
conversions (and therefore rewrites) can be automated further by using
functions which take a conversion and search for instances at which
they are applicable. Examples of these functions are </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ONCE_DEPTH_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RAND_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The first argument to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">GEN_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is such a
function, which specifies a search strategy; i.e. it specifies how
subterms (on which substitutions are allowed) should be searched for.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The second and third arguments are lists of theorems used for
rewriting. The order in which these are used is not specified. The
theorems need not be in equational form: negated terms, say </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">"~&nbsp;t"</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">,
are transformed into the equivalent equational form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">"t&nbsp;=&nbsp;F"</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, while
other non-equational theorems with conclusion of form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">"t"</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are cast
as the corresponding equations </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">"t&nbsp;=&nbsp;T"</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. Conjunctions are separated
into the individual components, which are used as distinct rewrites.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">GEN_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails if the search strategy fails. It may also
cause a non-terminating sequence of rewrites, depending on the search
strategy used. The resulting tactic is invalid when a theorem which
matches the goal (and which is thus used for rewriting it with) has a
hypothesis which is not alpha-convertible to any of the assumptions of
the goal. Applying such an invalid tactic may result in a proof of
a theorem which does not correspond to the original goal.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Given a goal such as:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   ?- a - (b + c) = a - (c + b)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
we may want to rewrite only one side of it with a theorem,
say </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ADD_SYM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. Rewriting tactics which operate recursively result in
divergence; the tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ONCE_REWRITE_TAC&nbsp;[ADD_SYM]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> rewrites on both
sides to produce the following goal:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   ?- a - (c + b) = a - (b + c)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
as </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ADD_SYM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> matches at two positions. To rewrite on
only one side of the equation, the following tactic can be used:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   GEN_REWRITE_TAC (RAND_CONV o ONCE_DEPTH_CONV) empty_rewrites [ADD_SYM]
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
which produces the desired goal:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   ?- a - (c + b) = a - (c + b)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">As another example, one can write a tactic which will behave similarly
to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWRITE_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> but will also include </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ADD_CLAUSES</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the set of
theorems to use always:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   val ADD_REWRITE_TAC = GEN_REWRITE_TAC TOP_DEPTH_CONV
                             (add_rewrites (implicit_rewrites ())
                                           [ADD_CLAUSES])
