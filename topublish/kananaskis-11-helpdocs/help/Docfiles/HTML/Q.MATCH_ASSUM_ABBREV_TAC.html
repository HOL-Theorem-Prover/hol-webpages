<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">When applied to the goal </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(asl,&nbsp;w)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q.MATCH_ASSUM_ABBREV_TAC&nbsp;q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
parses the quotation </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the context of the goal, producing a term to use as
a pattern. The tactic then attempts a (first order) match of the pattern
against each term in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">asl</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, stopping on the first matching assumption </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">a</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.
Variables that occur in both the pattern and the goal are treated as &ldquo;local
constants&rdquo;, and will not acquire instantiations.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">For each variable </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the pattern that has not been treated as a local
constant, there will be an instantiation term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, such that the substitution
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pattern[v1&nbsp;|-&gt;&nbsp;t1,&nbsp;v2&nbsp;|-&gt;&nbsp;t2,&nbsp;...]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> produces </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">a</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The effect of the tactic is
to then perform abbreviations in the goal, replacing each </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> with the
corresponding </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, and adding assumptions of the form </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Abbrev(v&nbsp;=&nbsp;t)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to the
goal.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
