<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">A call to the tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">q&nbsp;suffices_by&nbsp;tac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will first attempt to parse
the quotation </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the context of the current goal. Assuming this
generates a term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">qt</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> of boolean type, it will then generate two
sub-goals. Assuming the current goal is </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">asl&nbsp;?-&nbsp;g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the first new
sub-goal will be that </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">qt</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> implies </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, thus </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">asl&nbsp;?-&nbsp;qt&nbsp;==&gt;&nbsp;g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The

<SPAN class = "TEXT">The system next applies </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to the first sub-goal (the implication).
If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> solves the goal (the common or at least, desired, case), the
user will then be presented with one goal, where the original </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> has
been replaced with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">qt</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. In this way, the user has adjusted the goal,
replacing the old </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">g</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> with a </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">qt</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> that is sufficient to prove it.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">suffices_by</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is designed to support a backwards style of
reasoning. Superficially, it appears to be dual to the tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">by</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">,
which provides a forward-reasoning facility. In fact, both are
implementing a backwards application of the sequent calculus&rsquo;s &ldquo;cut&rdquo;
rule; the difference is which of the two premises to the rule is
worked on by the provided tactics.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
