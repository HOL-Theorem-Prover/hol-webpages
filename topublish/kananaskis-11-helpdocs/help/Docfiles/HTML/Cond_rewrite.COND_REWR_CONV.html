<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is one of the basic building blocks for the
implementation of the simple conditional rewriting conversions in the
HOL system. In particular, the conditional term replacement or
rewriting done by all the conditional
rewriting conversions in this library is ultimately done by applications of
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  The description given here for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> may
therefore be taken as a specification of the atomic action of
replacing equals by equals in a term under certain conditions that
are used in all these higher level conditional rewriting conversions.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The first argument to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is expected to be a function
which returns a list of matches. Each of these matches is in the form
of the value returned by the built-in function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">match</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. It is used to
search the input term for instances which may be rewritten.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The second argument to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is expected to be an
implicative theorem in the following form:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   A |- !x1 ... xn. P1 ==&gt; ... Pm ==&gt; (Q[x1,...,xn] = R[x1,...,xn])
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
where </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">xn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are all the variables that occur free in the
left hand side of the conclusion of the theorem but do not occur free in the
assumptions.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The last argument to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is the term to be rewritten.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">fn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a function and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is an implicative theorem of the kind
shown above, then </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_CONV&nbsp;fn&nbsp;th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will be a conversion.
When applying to a term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, it will return a theorem
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   P1', ..., Pm' |- tm = tm[R'/Q']
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
if evaluating </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">fn&nbsp;Q[x1,...,xn]&nbsp;tm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> returns a
non-empty list of matches.
The assumptions of the resulting theorem are instances of the
antecedents of the input theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The right hand side of the
equation is obtained by rewriting the input term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> with instances of
the conclusion of the input theorem.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_CONV&nbsp;fn&nbsp;th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails if </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is not an implication of the form
described above.  If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is such an equation, but the function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">fn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
returns a null list of matches, or the function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">fn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> returns a
non-empty list of matches, but the term or type instantiation fails.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The following example illustrates a straightforward use of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.
We use the built-in theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">LESS_MOD</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> as the input theorem, and the function
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">search_top_down</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> as the search function.
