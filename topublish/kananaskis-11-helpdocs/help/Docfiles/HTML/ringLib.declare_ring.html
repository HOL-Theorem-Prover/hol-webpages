<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Given a record gathering information about a ring structure,
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">declare_ring</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> returns two conversions </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">NormConv</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">EqConv</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The
former does simplifications on any ring expression. Ring expressions
are HOL terms built on the ring operations and the constants (or
values) of that ring. Other subterms are abstracted and considered as
variables.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The simplification of the expression (that can be seen as a
polynomial) consists in developing, reordering monomials and grouping
terms of same degree.  </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">EqConv</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> solves an equality by simplifying both
sides, and then using reflexivity. This cannot exactly be achieved by
applying </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">NormConv</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> on both hand sides, since the variable ordering is
not necessarily the same for both sides, and then applying reflexivity
may not be enough.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The input structure contains various information about the ring: field
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Name</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a prefix that will be used when declaring new constants for
internal use of the conversions. </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Theory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a proof that a given
structure is a ring or a semi-ring. </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Const</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a predicate on HOL
terms that defines the constants of the ring. </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Rewrites</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a bunch of
rewrites that should allow to compute the ring operations and also
decide equality upon constants. If (Const c1) and (Const c2) then (c1
+ c2) and (c1 * c2) should simplify to terms c and c&rsquo; such that
(Const c) and (Const c&rsquo;), and also (c1 = c2) should simplify to either
T or F.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
