<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The parsing process for terms divides into four distinct phases.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The first phase converts the quotation argument into abstract syntax,
a relatively simple parse tree datatype, with the following datatype
definition (from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Absyn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">):
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   datatype vstruct
       = VAQ    of term
       | VIDENT of string
       | VPAIR  of vstruct * vstruct
       | VTYPED of vstruct * pretype
   datatype absyn
       = AQ    of term
       | IDENT of string
       | APP   of absyn * absyn
       | LAM   of vstruct * absyn
       | TYPED of absyn * pretype
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
This phase of parsing is concerned with the treatment of the
rawest concrete syntax.  It has no notion of whether or not a term
corresponds to a constant or a variable, so all </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">preterm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> leaves are
ultimately either </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">IDENT</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">s or </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">AQ</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">s (anti-quotations).</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">This first phase converts infixes, mixfixes and all the other
categories of syntactic rule from the global grammar into simple
structures built up using </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">APP</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  For example, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">`x&nbsp;op&nbsp;y`</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (where </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">op</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
is an infix) will turn into
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   APP(APP(IDENT "op", IDENT "x"), IDENT "y")
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">`tok1&nbsp;x&nbsp;tok2&nbsp;y`</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (where </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tok1&nbsp;_&nbsp;tok2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> has been declared as a
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">TruePrefix</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> form for the term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) will turn into
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   APP(APP(IDENT "f", IDENT "x"), IDENT "y")
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The special syntaxes for &ldquo;let&rdquo; and record expressions are also
handled at this stage.  For more details on how this is done see the
reference entry for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Absyn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, which function can be used in
isolation to see what is done at this phase.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The second phase of parsing consists of the resolution of names,
identifying what were just </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">VAR</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">s as constants or genuine variables
(whether free or bound).  This phase also annotates all leaves of the
data structure (given in the entry for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Preterm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) with type
information.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The third phase of parsing works over the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Preterm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> datatype and does
type-checking, though ignoring overloaded values.  The datatype being
operated over uses reference variables to allow for efficiency, and
the type-checking is done &ldquo;in place&rdquo;.  If type-checking is
successful, the resulting value has consistent type annotations.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The final phase of parsing resolves overloaded constants.  The
type-checking done to this point may completely determine which choice
of overloaded constant is appropriate, but if not, the choice may
still be completely determined by the interaction of the possible
types for the overloaded possibilities.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Finally, depending on the value of the global flags </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">guessing_tyvars</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">guessing_overloads</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the parser will make choices about how to
resolve any remaining ambiguities.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The parsing process is entirely driven by the global grammar.  This
value can be inspected with the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">term_grammar</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> function.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
