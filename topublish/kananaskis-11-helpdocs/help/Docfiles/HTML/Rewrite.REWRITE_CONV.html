<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Rewriting a term using </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWRITE_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> utilizes as rewrites two sets
of theorems: the tautologies in the ML list </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">implicit_rewrites</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and the
ones supplied by the user. The rule searches top-down and recursively
for subterms which match the left-hand side of any of the possible
rewrites, until none of the transformations are applicable. There is no
ordering specified among the set of rewrites.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Variants of this conversion allow changes in the set of equations used:
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">PURE_REWRITE_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and others in its family do not rewrite with the
theorems in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">implicit_rewrites</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The top-down recursive search for matches may not be desirable, as
this may increase the number of inferences being made or may result in
divergence. In this case other rewriting tools such as
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ONCE_REWRITE_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">GEN_REWRITE_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> can be used, or the set of
theorems given may be reduced.</SPAN>

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Used to manipulate terms by rewriting them with theorems.
While resulting in high degree of automation, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REWRITE_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> can
spawn a large number of inference steps. Thus, variants such
as </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">PURE_REWRITE_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, or other rules such as </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">SUBST_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, may be used
instead to improve efficiency.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
