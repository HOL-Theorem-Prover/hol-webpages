<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ssfrag</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> type is the way in which simplification components are
packaged up and made available to the simplifier (though </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ssfrag</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
values must first be turned into simpsets, either by addition to an
existing simpset, or with the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">mk_simpset</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> function).</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The big record type passed to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">SSFRAG</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> as an argument has seven
fields.  Here we describe each in turn.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> field is a list of &ldquo;AC theorem&rdquo; pairs.  Each such pair is
the pair of theorems stating that a given binary function is
associative and commutative.  The theorems can be given in either
order, can present the associativity theorem in either direction, and
can be generalised to any extent.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">congs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> field is a list of congruence theorems justifying the
addition of theorems to simplification contexts.  For example, the
congruence theorem for implication is
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   |- (P = P') ==&gt; (P' ==&gt; (Q = Q')) ==&gt; (P ==&gt; Q = P' ==&gt; Q')
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
This theorem encodes a rewriting strategy.  The consequent
of the chain of implications is the form of term in question, where
the appropriate components have been rewritten.  Then, in
left-to-right order, the various antecedents of the implication
specify the rewriting strategy which gives rise to the consequent.  In
this example, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">P</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is first simplified to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">P'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> without any additional
context, then, using </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">P'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> as additional context, simplification of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
proceeds, producing </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  Another example is a rule for conjunction:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   |- (P ==&gt; (Q = Q')) ==&gt; (Q' ==&gt; (P = P')) ==&gt; ((P /\ Q) = (P' /\ Q'))
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Here </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">P</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is assumed while </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is simplified to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  Then,
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is assumed while </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">P</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is simplified to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">P'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  If a antecedent
doesn&rsquo;t involve the relation in question (here, equality) then it is
treated as a side-condition, and the simplifier will be recursively
invoked to try and solve it.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Higher-order congruence rules are also possible.  These provide a
method for dealing with bound variables.  The following is a rule for
the restricted universal quantifier, for example:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   |- (P = Q) ==&gt; (!v. v IN Q ==&gt; (f v = g v)) ==&gt;
      (RES_FORALL P f = RES_FORALL Q g)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">(If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is an abstraction, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">\x.&nbsp;t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, then </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">RES_FORALL&nbsp;P&nbsp;f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is
pretty-printed as </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">!x::P.&nbsp;t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) Terms in the conclusions of higher-order
congruence rules that might be abstractions (such as </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> above) should
be kept as variables, rather than written out as abstractions.  In
other words, the conclusion of the congruence rule above should not be
written as
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   RES_FORALL P (\v. f v) = RES_FORALL Q (\v. g v)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">convs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> field is a list of conversions that the simplifier will
apply.  Each conversion added to an </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ssfrag</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> value is done so in a
record consisting of four fields.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">conv</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> field of this subsidiary record type includes the value of
the conversion itself.  When the simplifier applies the conversion it
is actually passed two extra arguments (as the type indicates).  The
first is a solver function that can be used to recursively do
side-condition solving, and the second is a stack of side-conditions
that have been accumulated to date.  Many conversions will typically
ignore these arguments (as in the example below).</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">key</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> field of the subsidiary record type is an optional pattern,
specifying the places where the conversion should be applied.  If the
value is </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">NONE</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, then the conversion will be applied to all sub-terms.
If the value is </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">SOME(lcs,&nbsp;t)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, then the term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is used as a pattern
specifying those terms to which the conversion should be applied.
Further, the list </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">lcs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (which must be a list of variables), specifies
those variables in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> which shouldn&rsquo;t be generalised against; they
are effectively local constants.  Note, however, that the types in the
pattern term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will not be used to eliminate possible matches, so
that if a match is desired with a particular type instantiation of a
term, then the conversion will need to reject the input itself.  The
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">name</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">trace</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fields are only relevant to the debugging
facilities of the simplifier.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">dprocs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> field of the record passed to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">SSFRAG</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is where decision
procedures can be specified.  Documentation describing the

<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">filter</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> field of the record is an optional function, which, if
