<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_infix_definition</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> provides a facility for
definitional extensions to the current theory.  It takes a triple
consisting of the name under which the resulting definition will be
saved in the current theory segment, a term giving the desired
definition and an integer giving the precedence of the infix.  The
value returned by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_infix_definition</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a theorem which states the
definition requested by the user.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Let </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v_1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v_2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> be tuples of distinct variables, containing the variables
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x_1,...,x_m</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  Evaluating </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_infix_definition&nbsp;(name,&nbsp;ix&nbsp;v_1&nbsp;v_2&nbsp;=&nbsp;t)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
declares the sequent </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">({},\v_1&nbsp;v_2.&nbsp;t)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to be a definition in the 
current theory, and declares </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ix</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to be a new constant in the
current theory with this definition as its specification.
This constant specification is returned as a theorem with the form
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   |- !x_1 ... x_m. v_1 ix v_2 = t
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
and is saved in the current theory under
(the name) </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">name</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  Optionally, the definitional term argument
may have any of its variables universally quantified.
The constant </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ix</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> has infix status only after the infix
declaration has been processed.  It is therefore necessary to use
the constant in normal prefix position when making the definition.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_infixl_definition</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails if </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> contains free
variables that are not in either of the variable structures </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v_1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v_2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (this is equivalent to requiring </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">\v_1&nbsp;v_2.&nbsp;t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to be a closed
term); or if any variable occurs more than once in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v_1,&nbsp;v_2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  It
also fails if the precedence level chosen for the infix is already
home to parsing rules of a different form of fixity (infixes
associating in a different way, or suffixes, prefixes etc).  Finally,
failure occurs if there is a type variable in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v_1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">v_n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> or </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
that does not occur in the type of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ix</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">It is a common practice among HOL users to write a </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">$</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> before
the constant being defined as an infix to indicate that after the
definition is made, it will have a special syntactic status; ie. to
write:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   new_infixl_definition("ix_DEF", Term `$ix m n = ... `)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
This use of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">$</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is not necessary; but after the definition
has been made </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">$</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> must, of course, be used if the syntactic status
needs to be suppressed.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">In releases of hol98 past Taupo 1, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_infixl_definition</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and its
sister </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_infixr_definition</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> replace the old </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_infix_definition</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">,
which has been superseded.  Its behaviour was to define a right
associative infix, so can be freely replaced by
