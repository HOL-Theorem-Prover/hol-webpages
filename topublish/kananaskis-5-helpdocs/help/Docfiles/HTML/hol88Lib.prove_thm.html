<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Found in the hol88 library. When applied to a triple </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(s,tm,tac)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">,
giving the name to save the theorem under, the term to prove (with no
assumptions) and the tactic to perform the proof, the function
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">prove_thm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> attempts to prove the goal </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">?-&nbsp;tm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, that is, the term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
with no assumptions, using the tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">tac</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">prove_thm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> succeeds, it
attempts to save the resulting theorem in the current theory segment,
and if this succeeds, the saved theorem is returned.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Fails if the term is not of type </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">bool</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (and so cannot possibly be
the conclusion of a theorem), or if the tactic cannot solve the goal.
In addition, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">prove_thm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will fail if the theorem cannot be saved, e.g. because
there is already a theorem of that name in the current theory segment, or if
the resulting theorem has assumptions; clearly this can only happen if the
tactic was invalid, so this gives some measure of validity checking. The 
function is not available unless the hol88 library has been loaded.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
