<h1>Emacs HOL mode</h1>

<p> This page attempts to describe how to use the Emacs hol-mode that is
distributed with HOL.

<h2>A note on key-combination notation</h2>

<p> <code>C-x</code> is notation for "control-x", which stands for hitting
the <code>x</code> key at the same time as holding down the Control
key.  Similarly, <code>M-h</code> stands for "meta-h", which means
doing the same but with the meta key.  On PC keyboards, the ALT key
often stands in for a meta key.  If this doesn't work, you can get a
meta effect by first hitting ESC and then the next key (h in this
case).  If you can get the proper, modifier-key meta working, it's
definitely worthwhile, as having to hit ESC all the time is tedious in
the extreme.</p>

<h2>Installing the emacs mode</h2>

<p> Put
<pre>
(autoload 'hol "&lt;holdir&gt;/tools/hol-mode"
  "Runs a HOL session in a comint window.
With a numeric prefix argument, runs it niced to that level
or at level 10 with a bare prefix. " t)
</pre>

<p> into your <code>.emacs</code> file,
where <code>&lt;holdir&gt;</code> is where you installed HOL.  This
approach has the disadvantage that you have to start HOL
using <kbd>M-x hol</kbd>; you can't use the key sequence <kbd>M-h
h</kbd>.  If you want that, you can use
<pre>
(load "&lt;holdir&gt;/tools/hol-mode")
</pre>
<p> in the <code>.emacs</code> file.

<p>Alternatively, if you just want to try it once, type
<pre>
M-x load-file
</pre>

<p> and type <code>&lt;holdir&gt;/tools/hol-mode.el</code> in response
to the prompt.

<h2>Using the emacs mode</h2>

<p> My usual way of starting is:

<pre>
C-x C-f fooScript.sml   (* find my file *)
M-h h                   (* start my hol; it takes over the window *)
C-x b fooScript.sml     (* go back to my script file *)
C-x 5 b *HOL*           (* go to the HOL buffer in a separate window *)
</pre>

<p> I also recommend that you enable <code>transient-mark-mode</code>.
This makes it more obvious what you have selected.  You can enable
this for all sessions by putting <code>(transient-mark-mode 1)</code>
in your <code>.emacs</code> file, or as a once-off, by typing
<code>M-x transient-mark-mode</code> (and typing the same again will
turn it back off).

<p> To select text, move the cursor in your source buffer to one end
or other of the text to be sent and hit <code>C-SPC</code>.  This
starts text selection.  Then move the cursor to the other end of the
text to be sent.  With <code>transient-mark-mode</code> on, you should
see the text highlight.  This is useful visual feedback that what
you’re doing makes sense.  Of course, you don’t need to just move one
character at a time to select text; use the up and down cursor keys to
select lines at a time, <code>C-a</code> and <code>C-e</code> to move
to the starts and ends of lines, and <code>M-b</code> and
<code>M-f</code> to move backwards and forwards over words.

<p>Once you’re happy that you've highlighted the right bit of text, hit
<dl>
  <dt> <code>M-h M-r</code>
  <dd> to send the region to be evaluated as is by the interpreter; or
  <dt> <code>M-h e</code>
  <dd> to send the region to be applied as a tactic, i.e., as if
           wrapped in <code>e(...)</code>.
</dl>

<p> Both of these will analyse the text being sent to pre-emptively
load modules that the text depends on.  (This is an <strong>extremely
useful</strong> feature, and saves you having to start every session
by issuing <code>load</code> instructions to the interpreter.)

<p><em>Aside:</em> Two more things about text selection in emacs.  You
can flip your cursor to be at the other end of the selected region by
hitting <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd>.  The end of the text where you were then
becomes the anchor point for further selection. Further, if you find
yourself highlighting something and don't want to be in
"highlight-mode", hit <kbd>C-g</kbd>.  This stops highlighting.

<p>Finally, if you find you don’t like the text-highlighting that you
get with <code>transient-mark-mode</code> on, you can do all of the
above without it, but you don’t get the highlighting and you need to
be aware that the region between the cursor and where you last hit
<kbd>C-SPC</kbd> is always available to be sent.  (With
<code>transient-mark-mode</code> on, but nothing highlighted, an
attempt to do <code>M-h M-r</code> will just make Emacs beep and say
"The mark is not active now".) I find the absence of high-lighting
off-putting myself, but this is the way Emacs used to be and I guess
some people may still like it.<p>

<hr>

<p> Sending a goal is even easier, because goals just about always
appear between two backquote symbols.  If you put your cursor in such
a position (<em>i.e.</em> somewhere on a goal in your script file, but
not on the backquote characters themselves), all you need to do is
hit <kbd>M-h g</kbd>, and the text between the backquotes will be
sent to be set up as a goal in the goalstack package.

<p>
These are the basic commands.  See the section below for even more,
and learn how to control the HOL session entirely from your original
text buffer.

<h2>HOL mode commands</h2>

<p> To issue one of these commands, type <kbd>M-h</kbd> followed by
the given key-combination, or type <kbd>M-x</kbd> followed by the
long name of the command, given between quotes
(<code>``...''</code>).  If a command mentions a dependency on
a <em>prefix argument</em>, this can be supplied by
hitting <kbd>C-u</kbd>, typing in a number, and then continuing with
the rest of the commend.

<dl>
<dt> <kbd>h ``hol''</kbd>
<dd> Starts the HOL session.<p>

<dt> <kbd>C-a ``hol-toggle-show-assums''</kbd>
<dd> Toggles the value of the <code>show_assums</code> variable, affecting
     whether or not assumptions are printed as dots or full terms.
<dt> <kbd>C-c ``hol-interrupt''</kbd>
<dd> Interrupts the HOL session.  Useful for those tactics that don't
always return.

<dt> <kbd>C-f ``hol-toggle-goalstack-fvs''</kbd>
<dd> Toggles the display of the goal&rsquo;s free variables every time
the goal is printed.  This can be useful when a goal picks up multiple
variables of different types.</dd>

<dt> <kbd>C-l ``hol-recentre''</kbd>
<dd> Recentres the screen that HOL is running
  in, so that the most text is visible with the bottom of the text
  at the bottom of the screen.

<dt> <kbd>C-o ``hol-toggle-goalstack-print-goal-at-top''</kbd>
<dd> When this flag is true (the default), the goal-stack manager
prints goals with the goal first, a line of hyphens and then the
assumptions.  When the flag is false, the goal is at the bottom of the
presentation, with assumptions above it.

<dt> <kbd>C-v ``hol-scroll-up''</kbd>
<dd> Scrolls the HOL window.

<dt> <kbd>C-t ``hol-toggle-show-types''</kbd>
<dd> Toggles the value of the <code>show_types</code> variable,
affecting how terms are printed.

<dt> <kbd>M-a ``hol-toggle-goalstack-num-assums''</kbd>
<dd> With a <em>prefix argument</em>, sets the number of assumptions
that should be printed with each goal.  The default value is 10000. If
the limit is <em>n</em>, and there are more than <em>n</em>
assumptions, then the goal will be printed with its <em>n</em> most
recent assumptions.  Without a <em>prefix argument</em>, this will
toggle from <em>n ≠ 0</em> to <em>n = 0</em>, and from <em>n = 0</em>
to <em>n = 1</em>.
<dt> <kbd>M-b  ``backward-hol-tactic''</kbd>
<dd> Moves the cursor back over the
  previous tactic in the source text in the current buffer.  With a
  <em>prefix argument</em>, moves back that many tactics.
<dt> <kbd>M-f   ``forward-hol-tactic''</kbd>
<dd> Moves the cursor forward over the
  next tactic in the source text in the current buffer.  With a <em>prefix
  argument</em>, moves that many.
<dt> <kbd>M-r   ``send-region''</kbd>
<dd> Sends the <em>region</em> to the HOL
  process, where it is evaluated at the top level.  Can be used both
  to define new ML bindings, and to evaluate epxressions.
<dt> <kbd>M-s  ``hol-subgoal-tactic''</kbd>
<dd> Sends term at point (delimited by backquote characters) as a
subgoal.  Will usually create at least two sub-goals; one will be the
term just sent, and the others will be the term sent <code>STRIP_ASSUME</code>'d
onto the assumption list of the old goal.  (Loads the <code>Q</code> module if not
already loaded.)
<dt> <kbd>M-v ``hol-scroll-down''</kbd>
<dd> Scrolls the HOL window.
<dt> <kbd>b   ``hol-backup''</kbd>
<dd> Backs up one stage in the goalstack.
<dt> <kbd>d ``hol-drop-goal''</kbd>
<dd> Drops the current goal, removing it from
  the goal-stack entirely.
<dt> <kbd>D ``hol-drop-all-goals''</kbd>
<dd> Drops all goals.
<dt> <kbd>e ``expand-hol-tactic''</kbd>
<dd> Sends the region to the HOL process as
  a tactic, where it is applied to the current goal.
<dt> <kbd>g ``hol-goal''</kbd>
<dd> Sets the current goal.  Sends the term at point
  (delimited on both sides by back-quotes) to the HOL process.  With a
  <em>prefix argument</em>, or if in transient mark mode with an active
  region, sends the selected region as the goal instead.
<dt> <kbd>l ``hol-load-file''</kbd>
<dd> Loads a HOL library.  If there is a region
  marked, uses that string as the library to load.  Otherwise, if the
  cursor (point) is over a likely name, it uses that for the library
  to load.  As a last resort (or in all situations, if there is a
  <em>prefix argument</em>), prompts for the name of the library.
<dt> <kbd>m ``hol-db-match''</kbd>
<dd> Prompts for a term (don't put it in quotes) that is then used as
an argument to a call to <code>DB.match []</code>.  <em>Very</em> useful for
finding pertinent theorems.
<dt> <kbd>n ``hol-name-top-theorem''</kbd>
<dd> Prompts for a name to give to the
  ``top theorem'' (i.e., the theorem just proved in the goalstack).
  With a <em>prefix argument</em> also drops the goal.
<dt> <kbd>o ``hol-open-string''</kbd>
<dd> Opens HOL modules, prompting for the name of the module to load.
With prefix ARG, toggles quietdec variable before and after opening,
potentially saving a great deal of time as tediously large modules are
printed out.  (That's assuming that quietdec is false to start with.)
<dt> <kbd>p ``hol-print''</kbd>
<dd> Prints the top goal in the goalstack.
<dt> <kbd>r ``hol-rotate''</kbd>
<dd> Rotates goals in the goalstack.  With a
  numeric <em>prefix argument</em> rotates that many out of the way,
  instead of just one.
<dt> <kbd>R ``hol-restart''</kbd>
<dd> Restarts the current proof.
<dt> <kbd>s ``send-string-to-hol''</kbd>
<dd> Prompts for a string to be evaluated
  by SML, like <kbd>``M-r''</kbd>.
<dt> <kbd>t ``mark-hol-tactic''</kbd>
<dd> Marks the tactic at point, putting mark
  at the start of the tactic, and point at the end.  Useful as a
  prelude to applying the tactic with <kbd>``expand-hol-tactic''</kbd>.
<dt> <kbd>u ``hol-use-file''</kbd>
<dd> Prompts for a file-name to be <em>use</em>-d
  at the top level.
