<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">recInduct</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails if the goal is not universally quantified in a way

<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Suppose we had introduced a function for incrementing a number until it
no longer can be found in a given list:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   variant x L = if MEM x L then variant (x + 1) L else x
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Typically </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Hol_defn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> would be used to make such a definition, and some
subsequent proof would be required to establish termination. Once that
work was done, the specified recursion equations would be available as a
theorem and, as well, a corresponding induction theorem would also be
generated. In the case of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">variant</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the induction theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">variant_ind</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
is
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   |- !P. (!x L. (MEM x L ==&gt; P (x + 1) L) ==&gt; P x L) ==&gt; !v v1. P v v1
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Suppose now that we wish to prove that the variant with respect to a
list is not in the list:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   ?- !x L. ~MEM (variant x L) L`,
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
One could try mathematical induction, but that won&rsquo;t work well, since
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> gets incremented in recursive calls. Instead, induction with
&lsquo;</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">variant</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">-induction&rsquo; works much better. </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">recInduct</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> can be used to
apply such theorems in tactic proof. For our example,  
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">recInduct&nbsp;variant_ind</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> yields the goal
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   ?- !x L. (MEM x L ==&gt; ~MEM (variant (x + 1) L) L) ==&gt; ~MEM (variant x L) L
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
A few simple tactic applications then prove this goal.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
