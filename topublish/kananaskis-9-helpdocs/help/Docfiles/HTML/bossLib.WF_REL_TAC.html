<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">There are two problems to deal with when trying to prove termination.
First, one has to understand, intuitively and then mathematically,
why the function under consideration terminates. Second, one must
be able to phrase this in HOL. In the following, we shall give a few
examples of how this is done.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">There are a number of basic and advanced means of specifying wellfounded
relations. The most common starting point for dealing with termination
problems for recursive functions is to find some function, known as a a
&rsquo;measure&rsquo; under which the arguments of a function call are larger than
the arguments to any recursive calls that result.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">For a very simple starter example, consider the following definition
of a function that computes the greatest common divisor of two
numbers:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   - val gcd_defn = Hol_defn "gcd"
        `(gcd (0,n) = n) /\
         (gcd (m,n) = gcd (n MOD m, m))`;

            ?R. WF R /\ !v2 n. R (n MOD SUC v2,SUC v2) (SUC v2,n)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The recursion happens in the first argument, and the recursive call in
that position is a smaller number.  The way to phrase the termination of
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">gcd</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in HOL is to use a &lsquo;measure&lsquo; function to map from the domain of
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">gcd</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">---a pair of numbers---to a number.  The definition of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">measure</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">

(The actual definition of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">measure</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">prim_recTheory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is more

Sometimes one needs a measure function that is itself recursive.  For
example, consider a type of binary trees and a function that
&lsquo;unbalances&lsquo; trees. The algorithm works by rotating the tree until it
gets a </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Leaf</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in the left branch, then it recurses into the right
branch. At the end of execution the tree has been linearized.

Since the size of the tree is unchanged in the last clause in the
definition of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Unbal</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, a simple size measure will not work. Instead, we
can assign weights to nodes in the tree such that the recursive calls of
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Unbal</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> decrease the total weight in every case. One such assignment is
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>

Both of these subgoals are quite easy to prove.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The technique of &lsquo;weighting&lsquo; nodes in a tree in order to prove
termination also goes by the name of &lsquo;polynomial interpretation&lsquo;. It
must be admitted that finding the correct weighting for a termination
proof is more an art than a science. Typically, one makes a guess and
then tries the termination proof to see if it works.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Occasionally, there&rsquo;s a combination of factors that complicate the
termination argument. For example, the following specification
describes a naive pattern matching algorithm on strings (represented
as lists here). The function takes four arguments: the first is the
remainder of the pattern being matched. The second is the remainder of
the string being searched.  The third argument holds the original
pattern to be matched. The fourth argument is the string being
searched. If the pattern (first argument) becomes exhausted, then a
match has been found and the function returns </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">T</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. Otherwise, if the
string being searched becomes exhausted, the function returns </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">F</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   val match0_defn =
     Hol_defn "match0"
          `(match0 [] __ __ __ = T)
      /\   (match0 __ [] __ __ = F)
      /\   (match0 (p::pp) (s::ss) p0 rs =
             if p=s then match0 pp ss p0 rs else
             if NULL rs then F
                else match0 p0 (TL rs) p0 (TL rs))`;

   - val match = Define `match pat str = match0 pat str pat str`;
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The remaining case is when there&rsquo;s more searching to do; the function
checks if the head of the pattern is the same as the head of the
string being searched. If yes, then we recursively search, using the
tail of the pattern and the tail of the string being searched. If no,
that means that we have failed to match the pattern, so we should move
one character ahead in the string being searched and try again. If the
string being searched is empty, however, then we return </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">F</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The
second and third arguments both represent the string being
searched. The second argument is a kind of &lsquo;local&lsquo; version of the
string being searched; we recurse into it as long as there are matches
with the pattern. However, if the search eventually fails, then the
fourth argument, which &lsquo;remembers&lsquo; where the search started from, is
used to restart the search.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">So much for the behaviour of the function. Why does it terminate? There
are two recursive calls. The first call reduces the size of the first
and second arguments, and leaves the other arguments unchanged. The
second call can increase the size of the first and second arguments, but
reduces the size of the fourth.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">This is a classic situation in which to use a lexicographic ordering:
some arguments to the function are reduced in some recursive calls, and
some others are reduced in other recursive calls.  Recall that </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">LEX</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is
an infix operator, defined in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pairTheory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> as follows:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   LEX R1 R2 = \(x,y) (p,q). R1 x p \/ ((x=p) /\ R2 y q)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
In the second recursive call, the length of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">rs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is reduced, and in
the first it stays the same. This motivates having the length of the
fourth argument be the first component of the lexicographic
combination, and the length of the second argument as the second
component.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">What we need now is to formalize this. We want to map from the
four-tuple of arguments into a lexicographic combination of
relations. This is enabled by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">inv_image</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> from </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">relationTheory</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   inv_image R f = \x y. R (f x) (f y)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The actual relation maps from the four-tuple of arguments into a pair
of numbers </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(m,n)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, where </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">m</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is the length of the fourth argument, and
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is the length of the second argument. These lengths are then
compared lexicographically with respect to less-than (</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&lt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">).

   2 subgoals:
   &gt; val it =
    !rs ss s p.

<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The first subgoal needs a case-split on </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">rs</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> before it is proved by
rewriting, and the seconds is also easy to prove by rewriting.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">As a final example, one occasionally needs to recurse over
non-concrete data, such as finite sets or multisets. We can define a
&lsquo;fold&lsquo; function (of questionable utility) for finite sets as follows:
