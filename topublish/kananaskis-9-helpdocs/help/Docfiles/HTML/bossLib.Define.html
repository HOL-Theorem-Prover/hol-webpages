<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Define</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> takes a high-level specification of an HOL function, and

<SPAN class = "TEXT">
When processing the specification of a recursive function,
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Define</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> must perform a termination proof. It automatically constructs
termination conditions for the function, and invokes a termination
prover in an attempt to prove the termination conditions.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If the function is primitive recursive, in the sense that it exactly
follows the recursion pattern of a previously declared HOL datatype,
then this proof always succeeds, and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Define</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> stores the derived
equations in the current theory segment.  Otherwise, the function is
not an instance of primitive recursion, and the termination prover may
succeed or fail.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If it succeeds, then </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Define</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> stores the specified equations in the
current theory segment. An induction theorem customized for the defined
function is also stored in the current segment. Note, however, that an
induction theorem is not stored for primitive recursive functions, since
that theorem would be identical to the induction theorem resulting from
the declaration of the datatype.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If the termination proof fails, then </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Define</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fails.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">In general, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Define</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> attempts to derive exactly the specified
conjunction of equations. However, the rich syntax of patterns allows
some ambiguity. For example, the input
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
    Define `(f 0 _ = 1)
      /\    (f _ 0 = 2)`
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
is ambiguous at </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f&nbsp;0&nbsp;0</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">: should the result be </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> or </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">2</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">?
The system attempts to resolve this ambiguity in the same way as
compilers and interpreters for functional languages. Namely, a
conjunction of equations is treated as being processed left-conjunct
first, followed by processing the right conjunct. Therefore, in the
example above, the right-hand side of the first clause is taken as the
value of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f&nbsp;0&nbsp;0</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. In the implementation, ambiguities arising from such
overlapping patterns are systematically translated away in a
pre-processing step.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Another case of vagueness in patterns is shown above: the specification
is &lsquo;incomplete&lsquo; since it does not tell us how </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> should behave when
applied to two non-zero arguments: e.g., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">f&nbsp;(SUC&nbsp;m)&nbsp;(SUC&nbsp;n)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. In the
implementation, such missing clauses are filled in, and have the value
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ARB</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. This &lsquo;pattern-completion&lsquo; step is a way of turning descriptions
of partial functions into total functions suitable for HOL. However,
since the user has not completely specified the function, the system
takes that as a hint that the user is not interested in using the
function at the missing-but-filled-in clauses, and so such clauses are
dropped from the final theorem.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">In summary, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Define</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will derive the unambiguous and complete
equations
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>

from the above ambiguous and incomplete equations. The odd-looking
variable names are due to the pre-processing steps described above. The
above result is only an intermediate value: in the final result returned
by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Define</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the last equation is droppped:

<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Define</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> automatically generates names with which to store the

<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Since the names used to store elements in the current theory segment
are transformed into ML bindings after the theory is exported, it is
