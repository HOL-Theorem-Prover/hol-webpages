<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">This consequence conversion gets 3 lists of theorems as parameters:
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">both_thmL</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">strengthen_thmL</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">weaken_thmL</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.
The theorems in these lists are used to strengthen or weaken a given 
boolean term at toplevel. If using them for strengthening this consequence
conversion behaves similar to MATCH_MP. As the names suggest, the
theorems in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">strengthen_thmL</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are used for strengthening, the ones in
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">weaken_thmL</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> for weakening and the ones in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">both_thmL</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> for both.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Before trying to apply the conversion, the theorem lists are
preprocessed.  The theorems are split along conjunctions and
allquantification is removed. Then theorems with toplevel negation 
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">|-&nbsp;~P</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are rewritten to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">|-&nbsp;P&nbsp;=&nbsp;F</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. Afterwards every theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">|-&nbsp;P</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> that
is not an implication or an boolean equation is replaced by 
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">|-&nbsp;P&nbsp;=&nbsp;T</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. Finally, boolean equations </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">|-&nbsp;P&nbsp;=&nbsp;Q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are splitted into two
theorems </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">|-&nbsp;P&nbsp;==&gt;&nbsp;Q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">|-&nbsp;Q&nbsp;==&gt;&nbsp;P</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. One ends up with a list of
implications.</SPAN>

<SPAN class = "TEXT">Given a term </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> the conversion tries 
to find a theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">|-&nbsp;P&nbsp;==&gt;&nbsp;Q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and - depending on to the direction - 
strengthen </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">t</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> by matching it with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> or weaken it by
matching it with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">P</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
