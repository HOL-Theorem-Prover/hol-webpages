<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_rule</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a fundamental method for adding parsing
(and thus printing) rules to the global term grammar that sits behind
the functions </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Term</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">--</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, and the pretty-printer installed for
terms.  It is used for everything except the addition of list-forms,
for which refer to the entry for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_listform</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">There are five components in the record argument to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_rule</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  The
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">term_name</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> component is the name of the term (whether a constant or a
variable) that will be generated at the head of the function
application.  Thus, the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">term_name</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> component when specifying parsing
for conditional expressions is </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The following values (all in structure </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Parse</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) are useful for
constructing fixity values:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   val LEFT       : HOLgrammars.associativity
   val RIGHT      : HOLgrammars.associativity
   val NONASSOC   : HOLgrammars.associativity

   val Infix      : HOLgrammars.associativity * int -&gt; fixity
   val Prefix     : int -&gt; fixity
   val Suffix     : int -&gt; fixity
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Binder</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> fixity is for binders such as universal and existential
quantifiers (</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">!</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">?</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">).  Binders can actually be seen as (true)
prefixes (should </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">`!x.&nbsp;p&nbsp;/\&nbsp;q`</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> be parsed as </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">`(!x.&nbsp;p)&nbsp;/\&nbsp;q`</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> or as
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">`!x.&nbsp;(p&nbsp;/\&nbsp;q)`</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">?), but the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_rule</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> interface only allows binders to
be added at the one level (the weakest in the grammar).  Further, when
binders are added using this interface, all elements of the record
apart from the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">term_name</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are ignored, so the name of the binder must
be the same as the string that is parsed and printed  (but see also
restricted quantifiers: </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">associate_restriction</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">).</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The remaining fixities all cause </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_rule</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to pay due heed to the
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pp_elements</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> (&ldquo;parsing/printing elements&rdquo;) component of the
record.  As far as parsing is concerned, the only important elements
are </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">TOK</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">TM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> values, of the following types:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   val TM  : term_grammar.pp_element
   val TOK : string -&gt; term_grammar.pp_element
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">TM</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> value corresponds to a &ldquo;hole&rdquo; where a sub-term is
possible.  The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">TOK</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> value corresponds to a piece of concrete syntax,
a string that is required when parsing, and which will appear when
printing.   The sequence of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pp_elements</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> specified in the record
passed to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_rule</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> specifies the &ldquo;kernel&rdquo; syntax of an operator in the
grammar.  The &ldquo;kernel&rdquo; of a rule is extended (or not) by additional
sub-terms depending on the fixity type, thus:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   Closefix    :      [Kernel]     (* no external arguments *)
   Prefix      :      [Kernel] _   (* an argument to the right *)
   Suffix      :    _ [Kernel]     (* an argument to the left *)
   Infix       :    _ [Kernel] _   (* arguments on both sides *)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Thus simple infixes, suffixes and prefixes would have singleton
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pp_element</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> lists, consisting of just the symbol desired.  More
complicated mix-fix syntax can be constructed by identifying whether
or not sub-term arguments exist beyond the kernel of concrete syntax.
For example, syntax for the evaluation relation of an operational
semantics (</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">&nbsp;_&nbsp;|-&nbsp;_&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp;_&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) is an infix with a kernel delimited by
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">|-</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">--&gt;</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> tokens.  Syntax for denotation brackets </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">[|&nbsp;_&nbsp;|]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a
closefix with one internal argument in the kernel.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The remaining sorts of possible </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pp_element</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> values are concerned with
pretty-printing.  (The basic scheme is implemented on top of a
standard Oppen-style pretty-printing package.) They are

<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The two spacing values provide ways of specifying
white-space should be added when terms are printed.  Use of
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">HardSpace&nbsp;n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> results in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> spaces being added to the term whatever
the context.  On the other hand, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">BreakSpace(m,n)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> results in a break
of width </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">m</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> spaces unless this makes the current line too wide, in
which case a line-break will occur, and the next line will be indented
an extra </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> spaces.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">For example, the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_infix</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> function (q.v.) is implemented in terms
of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_rule</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> in such a way that a single token infix </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">s</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, has a
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pp_element</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> list of

   [HardSpace 1, TOK s, BreakSpace(1,0)]
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">This results in chains of infixes (such as those that occur
with conjunctions) that break so as to leave the infix on the right
hand side of the line.  Under this constraint, printing can&rsquo;t break so
as to put the infix symbol on the start of a line, because that would
imply that the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">HardSpace</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> had in fact been broken.  (Consequently, if
a change to this behaviour is desired, there is no global way of
effecting it, but one can do it on an infix-by-infix basis by deleting
the given rule (see, for example, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">remove_termtok</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) and then &ldquo;putting
it back&rdquo; with different pretty-printing constraints.)</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">PPBlock</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> function allows the specification of nested blocks
(blocks in the Oppen pretty-printing sense) within the list of
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pp_element</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">s.  Because there are sub-terms in all but the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Closefix</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
fixities that occur beyond the scope of the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pp_element</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> list, the
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">BeginFinalBlock</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">EndInitialBlock</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> functions can also be used to
indicate the boundary of blocks whose outer extent is the term beyond
the kernel represented by the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">pp_element</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> list.  There is an example
of this below.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The possible </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ParenStyle</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> values describe when parentheses should be
added to terms.  The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">OnlyIfNecessary</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> value will cause parentheses to
be added only when required to disambiguate syntax.  The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ParoundName</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
will cause parentheses to be added if necessary, or where the head
symbol has the given </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">term_name</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and where this term is not the
argument of a function with the same head name.  This style of
parenthesisation is used with tuples, for example.  The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ParoundPrec</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
value is similar, but causes parentheses to be added when the term is
the argument to a function with a different precedence level.
Finally, the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Always</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> value causes parentheses always to be added.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">PhraseBlockStyle</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> values describe when pretty-printing blocks
involving this term should be entered.  The </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">AroundEachPhrase</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> style
causes a pretty-printing block to be created around each term.  This
is not appropriate for operators such as conjunction however, where
all of the arguments to the conjunctions in a list are more pleasingly
thought of as being at the same level.  This effect is gained by
specifying either </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">AroundSamePrec</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> or </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">AroundSameName</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  The former
will cause the creation of a new block for the phrase if it is at a
different precedence level from its parent, while the latter creates
the block if the parent name is not the same.  The former is
appropriate for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">+</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">-</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> which are at the same precedence level,
while the latter is appropriate for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">/\</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  Finally, the </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">NoPhrasing</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
style causes there to be no block at all around terms controlled by
this rule.  The intention in using such a style is to have block
structure controlled by the level above.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
