<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">A simple conditional rewriting tactic.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWRITE1_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a front end of the conditional rewriting
tactic </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The input theorem should be in the following form
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   A |- !x11 ... . P1 ==&gt; ... !xm1 ... . Pm ==&gt; (!x ... . Q = R)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
where each antecedent </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Pi</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> itself may be a conjunction or disjunction.
This theorem is transformed to a standard form expected by
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> which carries out the actual rewriting.
The transformation is performed by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_CANON</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The search function
passed to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">search_top_down</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The effect of applying
this tactic is to substitute into the goal instances of the right hand
side of the conclusion of the input theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Ri'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> for the
corresponding instances of the left hand side. The search is top-down
left-to-right. All matches found by the search function are
substituted. New subgoals corresponding to the instances of the
antecedents which do not appear in the assumption of the original goal
are created. See manual page of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> for details of how the
instantiation and substitution are done.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">EXAMPLE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The following example illustrates a straightforward use of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWRITE1_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.
We use the built-in theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">LESS_MOD</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> as the input theorem.
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   #LESS_MOD;;
   Theorem LESS_MOD autoloading from theory `arithmetic` ...

<SPAN class = "TEXT">
We set up a goal

   #g"2 MOD 3 = 2";;
   "2 MOD 3 = 2"
