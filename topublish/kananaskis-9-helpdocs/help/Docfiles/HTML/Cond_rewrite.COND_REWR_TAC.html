<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">A lower level tactic used to implement simple conditional rewriting tactic.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">DESCRIPTION</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT"></SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is one of the basic building blocks for the
implementation of conditional rewriting in the HOL system. In
particular, the conditional term replacement or rewriting done by all
the built-in  conditional
rewriting tactics is ultimately done by applications of
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.  The description given here for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> may
therefore be taken as a specification of the atomic action of
replacing equals by equals in the goal under certain conditions that
aare used in all these higher level conditional rewriting tactics.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The first argument to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is expected to be a function
which returns a list of matches. Each of these matches is in the form
of the value returned by the built-in function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">match</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. It is used to
search the goal for instances which may be rewritten.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The second argument to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is expected to be an implicative theorem
in the following form:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   A |- !x1 ... xn. P1 ==&gt; ... Pm ==&gt; (Q[x1,...,xn] = R[x1,...,xn])
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
where </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">xn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are all the variables that occur free in the
left-hand side of the conclusion of the theorem but do not occur free in the
assumptions.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">fn</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is a function and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is an implicative theorem of the kind
shown above, then </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_TAC&nbsp;fn&nbsp;th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will be a tactic which returns
a list of subgoals if evaluating
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   fn Q[x1,...,xn] gl
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
returns a non-empty list of matches when applied to a goal
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">(asm,gl)</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Let </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ml</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> be the match list returned by evaluating </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">fn&nbsp;Q[x1,...,xn]&nbsp;gl</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.
Each element in this list is in the form of
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   ([(e1,x1);...;(ep,xp)], [(ty1,vty1);...;(tyq,vtyq)])
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
which specifies the term and type instantiations of the input theorem
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. Either the term pair list or the type pair list may be empty. In
the case that both lists are empty, an exact match is found, i.e., no
instantiation is required. If </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ml</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is an empty list, no match has been
found and the tactic will fail.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">For each match in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">ml</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will perform the following:
1) instantiate the input theorem </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">th</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> to get
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
   th' = A |- P1' ==&gt; ... ==&gt; Pm' ==&gt; (Q' = R')
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
where the primed subterms are instances of the corresponding
unprimed subterms obtained by applying </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">INST_TYPE</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> with
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">[(ty1,vty1);...;(tyq,vtyq)]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and then </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">INST</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> with </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">[(e1,x1);...;(ep,xp)]</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">;
2) search the assumption list </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">asm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> for occurrences of any antecedents
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">P1'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Pm'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">;
3) if all antecedents appear in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">asm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the goal </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">gl</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is reduced to
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">gl'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> by substituting </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">R'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> for each free occurrence of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Q'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, otherwise,
in addition to the substitution, all antecedents which do not appear
in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">asm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are added to it and new
subgoals corresponding to these antecedents are created. For example,
if </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Pk'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, ..., </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">Pm'</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> do not appear in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">asm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, the following subgoals
are returned:

   asm ?- Pk'  ...  asm ?- Pm'   {{asm,Pk',...,Pm'}} ?- gl'

antecedents, then, when carrying out Step 2 described
above, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_REWR_TAC</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will attempt to find instantiations for these
variables from the assumption </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">asm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. For example, if </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">y1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
occur free in </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">P1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, and a match is found in which </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">e1</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is an
