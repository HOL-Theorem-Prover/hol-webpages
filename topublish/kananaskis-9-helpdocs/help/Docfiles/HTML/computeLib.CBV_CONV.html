<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">The conversion </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">CBV_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> expects a simplification set and a
term. Its term argument is rewritten using the equations added in the
simplification set. The strategy used is somewhat similar to ML&rsquo;s,
that is call-by-value (arguments of constants are completely reduced
before the rewrites associated to the constant are applied) with weak
reduction (no reduction of the function body before the function is
applied). The main differences are that beta-redexes are reduced with
a call-by-name strategy (the argument is not reduced), and reduction
under binders is done when it occurs in a position where it cannot be
substituted.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">The simplification sets are mutable objects, this means they are
extended by side-effect. The function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">new_compset</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> will create 
a new set containing reflexivity (</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">REFL_CLAUSE</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">), plus the supplied rewrites.
Theorems can be added to an existing compset with the function </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_thms</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">It is also possible to add conversions to a simplification set with
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">add_conv</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. The only restriction is that a constant (</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">c</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) and an arity
(</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">) must be provided. The conversion will be called only on terms in
which </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">c</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> is applied to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">n</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> arguments.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Two theorem &ldquo;preprocessors&rdquo; are provided to control the strictness
of the arguments of a constant. </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">lazyfy_thm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> has pattern variables on
the left hand side turned into abstractions on the right hand
side. This transformation is applied on every conjunct, and removes
prenex universal quantifications. A typical example is </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_CLAUSES</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
  (COND T a b = a) /\ (COND F a b = b)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Using these equations is very inefficient because both </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">a</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">
and </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">b</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> are evaluated, regardless of the value of the boolean
expression. It is better to use </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND_CLAUSES</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> with the form above
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
  (COND T = \a b. a) /\ (COND F = \a b. b)
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
The call-by-name evaluation of beta redexes avoids computing
the unused branch of the conditional.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">Conversely, </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">strictify_thm</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> does the reverse transformation. This is
particularly relevant for </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">LET_DEF</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
  LET = \f x. f x   --&gt;   LET f x = f x
</pre></DIV>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">
This forces the evaluation of the argument before reducing the
beta-redex. Hence the usual behaviour of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">LET</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">.</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class = "TEXT">It is necessary to provide rules for all the constants appearing in the
expression to reduce (all also for those that appear in the right hand
side of a rule), unless the given constant is considered as a
constructor of the representation chosen. As an example,
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">reduceLib.num_compset</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> creates a new simplification set with all the
rules needed for basic boolean and arithmetical calculations built in.</SPAN></DIV></DD>

<SPAN class = "TEXT">
Failing to give enough rules may make </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">CBV_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> build a

The first invocation of </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">CBV_CONV</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> loops since the exponent
never reduces to 0.  Below the first steps are computed:
</SPAN><DIV class = "XMPL"><pre>
    exp 2 n

The call to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">set_skip</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> means that if the constants </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">COND</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">

example, if the condition does not reduce to </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">T</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> or </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">F</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">), then the
forthcoming arguments (the two branches of the conditional) are not
reduced at all.</SPAN></DIV></DD>
<DT><SPAN class = "FIELD-NAME">FAILURE</SPAN></DT>
<DD><DIV class = "FIELD-BODY"><SPAN class = "TEXT">Should never fail. Nonetheless, using rewrites with assumptions may
cause problems when rewriting under abstractions. The following
example illustrates that issue.

This fails because the 0 is replaced by </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">, making the assumption 
</SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">0&nbsp;=&nbsp;x</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT">. Then, the abstraction cannot be rebuilt since </SPAN><SPAN class = "BRKT">x</SPAN><SPAN class = "TEXT"> appears
