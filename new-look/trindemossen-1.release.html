<p>(Released: 25 April 2024)</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce the Trindemossen 1 release of HOL4. We
have changed the name (from Kananaskis) because of the kernel change
reflected by the new efficient compute tool (see <a
href="#verified-comp">below</a>).</p>

<h2 id="new-features">New features:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>HOL_CONFIG</code> environment variable is now consulted
when HOL sessions begin, allowing for a custom <code>hol-config</code>
configuration at a non-standard location, or potentially ignoring any
present hol-config. If the variable is set, any other hol-config file
will be ignored. If the value of <code>HOL_CONFIG</code> is a readable
file, it will be used.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a new theorem attribute, <code>unlisted</code>, which
causes theorems to be saved/stored in the usual fashion but kept
somewhat hidden from user-view. Such theorems can be accessed with
<code>DB.fetch</code>, and may be passed to other tools though the
action of other attributes, but will not appear in the results of
<code>DB.find</code> and <code>DB.match</code>, and will not occur as
SML bindings in theory files.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Holmake</code> will now look for <code>.hol_preexec</code>
files in the hierarchy surrounding its invocation. The contents of such
files will be executed by the shell before <code>Holmake</code> begins
its work. See the DESCRIPTION manual for more.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Holmake</code> (at least under Poly/ML) now stores most of
the products of theory-building in a “dot”-directory
<code>.holobjs</code>. For example, if <code>fooScript.sml</code> is
compiled, the result in the current directory is the addition of
<code>fooTheory.sig</code> only. The files <code>fooTheory.sml</code>,
<code>fooTheory.dat</code>, <code>fooTheory.uo</code> and
<code>fooTheory.ui</code> are all deposited in the <code>.holobjs</code>
directory. This reduces clutter.</p></li>
<li><p>Paralleling the existing <code>Excl</code> form for removing
specific theorems from a simplifier invocation, there is now a
<code>ExclSF</code> form (also taking a string argument) that removes a
simpset fragment from the simplifier. For example</p>
<pre><code>     &gt; simp[ExclSF &quot;BOOL&quot;] ([], “(λx. x + 1) (6 + 1)”);
     val it = ([([], “(λx. x + 1) 7”)], fn)</code></pre>
<p>where the <code>BOOL</code> fragment includes the treatment of
β-reduction.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bugs-fixed">Bugs fixed:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix <a
href="https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL/issues/1140">a failure
to define a polymorphic datatype with name <code>a</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-theories">New theories:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A theory of “contiguity types”, as discussed in the paper
<em>Specifying Message Formats with Contiguity Types</em>, ITP 2021.
(DOI: <a
href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2021.30">10.4230/LIPIcs.ITP.2021.30</a>)</p>
<p>Contiguity types express formal languages where later parts of a
string may depend on information held earlier in the string. Thus contig
types capture a class of context-sensitive languages. They are helpful
for expressing serialized data containing, for example, variable length
arrays. The soundness of a parameterized matcher is proved.</p></li>
<li><p><code>permutes</code>: The theory of permutations for general and
finite sets, originally ported from HOL-Light’s
<code>Library/permutations.ml</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>keccak</code>: Defines the SHA-3 standard family of hash
functions, based on the Keccak permutation and sponge construction.
Keccak256, which is widely used in Ethereum, is included and was the
basis for this work. A rudimentary computable version based on sptrees
is included; faster evaluation using cvcompute is left for future
work.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-tools">New tools:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The linear decision procedure for the reals
(<code>REAL_ARITH</code>, <code>REAL_ARITH_TAC</code> and
<code>REAL_ASM_ARITH_TAC</code>) have been updated by porting the latest
code from HOL-Light. There are two versions: those in the existing
<code>RealArith</code> package only support integral-valued
coefficients, while those in the new package <code>RealField</code>
support rational-valued coefficients (this includes division of reals,
e.g. <code>|- x / 2 + x /2 = x</code> can be proved by
<code>RealField.REAL_ARITH</code>). Users can explicitly choose between
different versions by explicitly opening <code>RealArith</code> or
<code>RealField</code> in their proof scripts. If <code>realLib</code>
were opened, the maximal backward compatibilities are provided by first
trying the old solver (now available as
<code>RealArith.OLD_REAL_ARITH</code>, etc.) and (if failed) then the
new solver. Some existing proofs from HOL-Light can be ported to HOL4
more easily.</p></li>
<li><p>New decision procedure for the reals ported from HOL-Light:
<code>REAL_FIELD</code>, <code>REAL_FIELD_TAC</code> and
<code>REAL_ASM_FIELD_TAC</code> (in the package <code>RealField</code>).
These new tools first try <code>RealField.REAL_ARITH</code> and then
turn to new solvers based on calculations of Grobner’s Basis (from the
new package <code>Grobner</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multiplying large numbers more efficiently</strong>:</p>
<p>In <code>src/real</code> there is a new library
<code>bitArithLib.sml</code> which improves the performance of large
multiplications for the types <code>:num</code> and <code>:real</code>.
The library uses arithmetic of bitstrings in combination with the
Karatsuba multiplication algorithm. To use the library, it has to be
loaded before the functions that should be evaluated are
<strong>defined</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><a name="verified-comp"><strong>Fast in-logic computation
primitive</strong>:</a> A port of the Candle theorem prover’s primitive
rule for computation, described in the paper <em>“Fast, Verified
Computation for Candle”</em> (ITP 2023), has been added to the kernel.
The new compute primitive works on certain operations on a lisp-like
datatype of pairs of numbers:</p>
<pre><code>     Datatype: cv = Pair cv cv
                  | Num num
     End</code></pre>
<p>This datatype and its operations are defined in
<code>cvScript.sml</code>, and the compute primitive
<code>cv_compute</code> is accessible via the library
<code>cv_computeLib.sml</code> (both in
<code>src/cv_compute</code>).</p>
<p>There is also new automation that enables the use of
<code>cv_compute</code> on functional HOL definitions which do not use
the <code>:cv</code> type. In particular, <code>cv_trans</code>
translates such definitions into equivalent functions operating over the
<code>:cv</code> type. These can then be evaluated using
<code>cv_eval</code>, which uses <code>cv_compute</code> internally.
Both <code>cv_trans</code> and <code>cv_eval</code> can be found in the
new <code>cv_transLib</code>.</p>
<p>Some usage examples are located in <code>examples/cv_compute</code>.
See the DESCRIPTION manual for a full description of the functionality
offered by <code>cv_compute</code>.</p>
<p>NB. To support <code>cv_compute</code>, the definitions of
<code>DIV</code> and <code>MOD</code> over natural numbers
<code>num</code> have been given specifications for the case when the
second operand is zero. We follow HOL Light and Candle in defining
<code>n DIV 0 = 0</code> and <code>n MOD 0 = n</code>. These changes
make <code>DIV</code> and <code>MOD</code> match the way Candle’s
compute primitive handles <code>DIV</code> and
<code>MOD</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Polarity-aware theorem-search</strong>. Extending what is
available through <code>DB.find</code> and <code>DB.match</code>, the
<code>DB.polarity_search</code> allows the user to search for explicitly
negative or positive occurrences of the specified pattern. Thanks to
Eric Hall for this contribution.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-examples">New examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Dependability Analysis</strong>: Dependability is an
umbrella term encompassing Reliability, Availability and
Maintainability. Two widely used dependability modeling techniques have
been formalized namely, Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD) and Fault Trees
(FT). Both these techniques graphically analyze the causes and factors
contributing the functioning and failure of the system under study.
Moreover, these dependability techniques have been highly recommended by
several safety standards, such as IEC61508, ISO26262 and EN50128, for
developing safe hardware and software systems.</p>
<p>The new recursive datatypes are defined to model RBD and FT providing
compositional features in order to analyze complex systems with
arbitrary number of components.</p>
<pre><code>    Datatype: rbd = series (rbd list)
                  | parallel (rbd list)
                  | atomic (α event)
    End

    Datatype: gate = AND (gate list)
                   | OR (gate list)
                   | NOT gate
                   | atomic (α event)
    End</code></pre>
<p>Some case studies are also formalized and placed with dependability
theories, for illustration purposes, including smart grids, WSN data
transport protocols, satellite solar arrays, virtual data centers, oil
and gas pipeline systems and an air traffic management system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>large_numberTheory</strong> (in
<code>examples/probability</code>): various versions of The Law of Large
Numbers (LLN) of Probability Theory.</p>
<p>Some LLN theorems (<code>WLLN_uncorrelated</code> and
<code>SLLN_uncorrelated</code>) previously in
<code>probabilityTheory</code> are now moved to
<code>large_numberTheory</code> with unified statements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vector and Matrix theories</strong> (in
<code>examples/vector</code>) translated from HOL-Light’s
<code>Multivariate/vectors.ml</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relevant Logic</strong> (in
<code>examples/logic/relevant-logic</code>): material contributed by
James Taylor, mechanising a number of foundational results for
propositional relevant logic. Three proof systems (two Hilbert, one
natural deduction) are shown equivalent, and two model theories (the
Routley-Meyer ternary-relation Kripke semantics, and Goldblatt’s “cover”
semantics) are shown sound and complete with respect to the proof
systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>armv8-memory-model</strong> (in
<code>examples/arm</code>): a port by Anthony Fox of Viktor Vafeiadis’s
<a href="https://github.com/vafeiadis/arm-model">Coq formalization of
the Armv8 Memory Model</a>, which is based on the official <a
href="https://github.com/herd/herdtools7/blob/95785c747750be4a3b64adfab9d5f5ee0ead8240/herd/libdir/aarch64.cat">mixed-size
Armv8 memory model</a> and associated <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3458926">paper</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>p</em>-adic numbers</strong> (in
<code>examples/padics</code>): a construction of the <em>p</em>-adic
numbers by Noah Gorrell. The approach taken defines the prime valuation
function <em>ν</em> on first the natural numbers and then the rationals.
It then defines the absolute value on ℚ so as to establish a <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span>-metric. Cauchy sequences over
these can be constructed and quotiented to construct a new numeric type.
The new type <code>adic</code> is polymorphic such that the cardinality
of the universe of the argument defines the prime number <em>p</em> of
the construction. For types that have infinite or non-prime universes,
<em>p</em> is taken to be 2. Thus, <code>:2 adic</code>,
<code>:4 adic</code> and <code>:num adic</code> are isomorphic types,
but <code>:3 adic</code> is distinct. Addition, multiplication and
injection from the rationals are defined.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="incompatibilities">Incompatibilities:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Some new automatic rewrites to do with natural number arithmetic
(particularly exponentiation) have been added. The most potentially
disruptive of these is probably <code>LT1_EQ0</code>, which states</p>
<pre><code>   ⊢ n &lt; 1 ⇔ n = 0</code></pre>
<p>The other new rewrites will simplify terms such as
<code>10 &lt; 2 ** x</code> (where both the base of the exponentiation
and the other argument to the relation are numerals). By taking a
natural number logarithm, it is possible to turn the above into
<code>3 &lt; x</code> and <code>5 ** n &lt; 10654</code> into
<code>n ≤ 5</code>. The theorems to exclude (using <code>Excl</code>, or
<code>temp_delsimps</code>, or …) if these new rules break proofs are:
<code>EXP_LE_LOG_SIMP</code>, <code>EXP_LT_LOG_SIMP</code>,
<code>LE_EXP_LOG_SIMP</code>, <code>LT_EXP_LOG_SIMP</code>,
<code>LOG_NUMERAL</code>, <code>EXP_LT_1</code>,
<code>ONE_LE_EXP</code>, and <code>TWO_LE_EXP</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The small <code>productTheory</code> (products of natural numbers
and real numbers, ported from HOL-Light) has been merged into
<code>iterateTheory</code> (on which <code>extrealTheory</code> now
depends).</p></li>
<li><p>Changes in the <code>formal-languages/context-free</code>
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The location type (defined in <code>locationTheory</code>) has been
simplified</li>
<li>The PEG machinery now has a simple error-reporting facility that
attempts to report the end of the longest prefix of the input that might
still be in the PEG’s language. This means that instead of returning
either <code>SOME result</code> or <code>NONE</code>, PEGs now return a
custom <code>Success</code>/<code>Failure</code> data type with values
attached to both constructors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The <code>MEMBER_NOT_EMPTY</code> theorem in
<code>bagTheory</code> has been renamed to
<code>BAG_MEMBER_NOT_EMPTY</code> to avoid a name-clash with a theorem
of the same name in <code>pred_setTheory</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The “global” simplification tactics (<code>gs</code>,
<code>gvs</code> <em>et al</em>) have been adjusted to simplify older
assumptions before later ones. This will keep assumption <em>A</em> in
the list if it is newer (more recently added) than, and equivalent to,
older assumption <em>B</em>. The new <code>rgs</code> is like the old
<code>gs</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The infix operator <code>..</code> from
<code>iterateTheory</code> is now called <code>numseg</code> and is
parsed/printed as <code>{m .. n}</code> (a “close-fix” operator). This
brings the syntax into line with <code>listRangeTheory</code>’s
<code>[m..n]</code> syntax. In many contexts, expressions with this had
to use parentheses as delimiters, and so fixing the incompatibility will
require turning something like <code>(t1..t2)</code> into
<code>{t1..t2}</code>. However, the old style did allow
<code>e ∈ m..n</code>, which no longer works without the
braces.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to internal dependency changes, <code>Diff.DIFF_CONV</code>
(a conversion for proving differentiate expressions) is not included in
<code>realLib</code> any more. Users of <code>DIFF_CONV</code> should
explicitly open <code>Diff</code> in proof scripts.</p></li>
<li><p>The internally-stored names (<code>string</code> values) for
various simpset fragments have been changed to lose <code>_ss</code>
suffixes. For example, though the <code>BETA_ss</code> fragment still
appears under that name in the SML namespace, the name it has stored
internally is now just <code>"BETA"</code>. This change makes the naming
consistent across all of HOL’s fragments. These names are used when
referring to fragments in calls to <code>diminish_srw_ss</code>, when
using <code>ExclSF</code> (see above), and in printing the values in the
REPL.</p></li>
<li><p>In <code>sigma_algebraTheory</code>, the definition of
<code>measurable</code> has been generalized without requiring that the
involved systems of sets must be σ-algebras. This change allows the user
to express measurable mappings over generators of σ-algebras
(cf. <code>MEASURABLE_LIFT</code> for a related important lemma).
Existing proofs may break in two ways (both are easy to fix): 1. The
need for extra antecedents (usually easily available) when applying some
existing measure and probability theorems. 2. When proving
<code>f IN measurable a b</code>, some proof branches regarding
σ-algebras no longer exists (thus the related proof scripts must be
eliminated).</p></li>
<li><p>Both the <code>Definition</code> syntax when a
<code>Termination</code> argument has been provided, and the underlying
<code>TotalDefn.tDefine</code> function, won’t now make schematic
definitions unless they have been explicitly allowed. (With the
<code>Definition</code> syntax, this is done by using the
<code>schematic</code> attribute.) This brings this flavour of
definition into line with the others, where the presence of extra free
variables on the RHS of a definition’s equation is usually flagged as an
error.</p></li>
<li><p>In <code>real_topologyTheory</code>, some definitions (only the
theorem names but not the underlying logical constants) have been
renamed to avoid conflicts with similar definitions in
<code>seqTheory</code>: from <code>sums</code> to <code>sums_def</code>,
from <code>summable</code> to <code>summable_def</code>. Besides,
<code>infsum</code> has been renamed to <code>suminf_def</code> to
reflect its overloading to <code>suminf</code>. (All these definitions
are generalized versions of those in <code>seqTheory</code>.)</p></li>
<li><p>The constant <code>lg</code> (logarithm with base 2) has moved
from the <code>util_prob</code> theory to <code>transc</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The theories under <code>src/ring/src</code> have all been
prefixed with the string <code>EVAL_</code> reflecting the way they are
exclusively used within the system, to provide polynomial normalisation
using reflection and <code>computeLib</code>. This frees up the name
<code>ring</code> to be used only by the material under
<code>examples/algebra</code>. (In the absence of this change, theories
that depended on what was in <code>src/ring/src</code> could not be used
in a development alongside what is in
<code>examples/algebra</code>.)</p></li>
<li><p>It is now an error to bind the same name twice in a theory.
Binding names is what happens when theorems are saved or stored, or when
definitions are made. These names appear in the exported
<em>thy</em><code>Theory.sig</code> files. Previously, rebound values
would replace old ones with only a warning interactively. Now an
exception is raised. In some circumstances when rebinding is
appropriate, the <code>allow_rebind</code> annotation can be used to
permit the behaviour. For example:</p>
<pre><code>   Theorem foo: p /\ q &lt;=&gt; q /\ p
   Proof DECIDE_TAC
   QED

   Theorem foo[allow_rebind]: p \/ q &lt;=&gt; q \/ p
   Proof DECIDE_TAC
   QED</code></pre>
<p>The content of the theorem is irrelevant; any attempt to rebind will
cause an error. Programmatically, the trace variable
<code>Theory.allow_rebinds</code> can be set to <code>1</code> to allow
the old behaviour. Thus, the following could be done at the head of a
script file to completely turn off checking for the whole file</p>
<pre><code>   val _ = set_trace &quot;Theory.allow_rebinds&quot; 1</code></pre>
<p>Rebinding is permitted dynamically when the
<code>Globals.interactive</code> flag is true so that interactive
development of theories is not hindered.</p></li>
<li><p>One error detected by the above change was in
<code>examples/miller/</code>’s <code>extra_bool</code> theory. This
defines an <code>xor</code> operator and included two successive
theorems:</p>
<pre><code>   [xor_F] : !p. p xor F = p
   [xor_F] : !p. F xor p = p</code></pre>
<p>The failure to flag the second as an error meant that the theorem
called <code>xor_F</code> completely masked the rewrite in the opposite
direction. The fix was to rename the second <code>xor_F</code> to now be
<code>F_xor</code>, which is an incompatibility if your theory depends
on <code>extra_boolTheory</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The labels for clauses/rules in the “modern”
<code>Inductive</code> syntax are now syntactically equivalent to
conjunctions, so what used to be written as something like</p>
<pre><code>   Inductive reln:
   [~name1:] (!x y. x &lt; y ==&gt; reln (x + 1) y) /\
   [~sym:]
      (!x y. reln x y ==&gt; reln y x) /\
   [~zero:]
      (!x. reln x 0)
   End</code></pre>
<p>should now be written</p>
<pre><code>   Inductive reln:
   [~name1:] (!x y. x &lt; y ==&gt; reln (x + 1) y)
   [~sym:]
      (!x y. reln x y ==&gt; reln y x)
   [~zero:]
      (!x. reln x 0)
   End</code></pre>
<p>where all of the trailing/separating conjunctions have been removed.
The parentheses around each clause above can also be removed, if
desired.</p>
<p>Attempting to mix labels and top-level conjunctions will lead to very
confusing results: it’s best to only use one or the other. If you do not
wish to name rules, you can use any of the following as “nullary”
labels: <code>[]</code>, <code>[/\]</code>, or <code>[∧]</code>. As with
normal labels, these need to occur in column zero.</p>
<p>The first rule need not have a label at all, so that</p>
<pre><code>   Inductive reln:
      !x y. x &lt; y ==&gt; reln (x + 1) y
   [/\]
      !x y. reln x y ==&gt; reln y x
   [~zero:]
      !x. reln x 0
   End</code></pre>
<p>will work. It will also work to switch to conjunctions for trailing
rules:</p>
<pre><code>   Inductive reln:
   [~name1:] !x y. x &lt; y ==&gt; reln (x + 1) y
   [~sym:]
      (!x y. reln x y ==&gt; reln y x) /\
      (!x. reln x 0) /\
      (!y. reln 100 y)
   End</code></pre></li>
<li><p>A number of theories embodying the “old” approach to measure
theory and probability (using a real number as a set’s measure rather
than an extended real) have moved from <code>src/probability</code> to
<code>examples/probability/legacy</code>. These theories are still used
by the dependability analysis example mentioned above, and by the
verification of the probabilistic Miller-Rabin primality test
(<code>examples/miller</code>). The effect of this is that the default
build of the system will not build these theories; <code>Holmake</code>
will build them when used in their new directory.</p></li>
<li><p>The mechanisation of temporal logic that used to live in
<code>src/temporal</code> has been moved to
<code>examples/logic/temporal</code>.</p></li>
