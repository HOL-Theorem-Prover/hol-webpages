<h2 id="new-features">New features:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The special <code>Type</code> syntax for making type abbreviations can now map to <code>temp_type_abbrev</code> (or <code>temp_type_abbrev_pp</code>) by adding the <code>local</code> attribute to the name of the abbreviation.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<pre><code>   Type foo[local] = “:num -&gt; bool # num”</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>   Type foo[local,pp] = “:num -&gt; bool # num”</code></pre>
<p>Thanks to Magnus Myreen for the feature suggestion.</p></li>
<li><p>We have added a special syntactic form <code>Overload</code> to replace various flavours of <code>overload_on</code> calls. The core syntax is exemplified by</p>
<pre><code>   Overload foo = “myterm”</code></pre>
<p>Attributes can be added after the name. Possible attributes are <code>local</code> (for overloads that won’t be exported) and <code>inferior</code> to cause a call <code>inferior_overload_on</code> (which makes the overload the pretty-printer’s last choice).</p>
<p>Thanks to Magnus Myreen for the feature suggestion.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>Holmake</code> tool will now build multiple targets across multiple directories in parallel. Previously, directories were attacked one at a time, and parallelisation only happened within those directories. Now everything is done at once. The existing <code>-r</code> option takes on a new meaning as part of this change: it now causes <code>Holmake</code> to build all targets in all directories accessible through <code>INCLUDES</code> directives. Without <code>-r</code>, <code>Holmake</code> will build just those dependencies necessary for the current set of targets (likely files/theories in the current directory).</p></li>
<li><p>It is now possible to write <code>let</code>-expressions more smoothly inside monadic <code>do</code>-<code>od</code> blocks. Rather than have to write something like</p>
<pre><code>   do
     x &lt;- M1;
     let y = E
     in
       do
         z &lt;- M2 x y;
         return (f z);
       od
   od</code></pre>
<p>one can replace the <code>let</code>-bindings with uses of the <code>&lt;&lt;-</code> arrow:</p>
<pre><code>   do
     x &lt;- M1;
     y &lt;&lt;- E;
     z &lt;- M2 x y;
     return (f z)
   od</code></pre>
<p>(The <code>&lt;&lt;-</code> line above is semantically identical to writing <code>y &lt;- return E</code>, but is nonetheless syntactic sugar for a <code>let</code>-expression.)</p>
<p>The pretty-printer reverses this transformation.</p>
<p>Thanks to Hrutvik Kanabar for the implementation of this feature.</p></li>
<li><p>There is (yet) another high-level simplification entry-point: <code>gs</code> (standing for “global simplification”). Like the others in this family this has type</p>
<pre><code>   thm list -&gt; tactic</code></pre>
<p>and interprets theorems as rewrites as with the others. This tactic simplifies all of a goal by repeatedly simplifying goal assumptions in turn (assuming all other assumptions as it goes) until no change happens, and then finishes by simplifying the goal conclusion, assuming all of the (transformed) assumptions as it does so.</p>
<p>There are three variants on this base (with the same type): <code>gns</code>, <code>gvs</code> and <code>gnvs</code>. The presence of the <code>v</code> indicates a tactic that eliminates variables (as is done by <code>rw</code> and some others), and the presence of the <code>n</code> causes assumptions to <em>not</em> be stripped as they are added back into the goal. Stripping (turned on by default) is the effect behind <code>strip_assume_tac</code> (and <code>strip_tac</code>) when these tactics add to the assumptions. It causes, for example, case-splits when disjunctions are added.</p>
<p>We believe that <code>gs</code> will often be a better choice than the existing <code>fs</code> and <code>rfs</code> tactics.</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic simplification of multiplicative terms over the real numbers is more aggressive and capable. Multiplicative terms are normalised, with coefficients being gathered, and variables sorted and grouped (<em>e.g.</em>, <code>z * 2 * x * 3</code> turns into <code>6 * (x * z)</code>). In addition, common factors are eliminated on either side of relation symbols (<code>&lt;</code>, <code>≤</code>, and <code>=</code>), and occurrences of <code>inv</code> (<code>⁻¹</code>) and division are rearranged as much as possible (<em>e.g.</em>, <code>z * x pow 2 * 4 = x⁻¹ * 6</code> turns into <code>x = 0 ∨ 2 * (x pow 3 * z) = 3</code>). To turn off normalisation over relations within a file, use</p>
<pre><code>   val _ = diminish_srw_ss [“RMULRELNORM_ss”]</code></pre>
<p>To additionally stop normalisation, use</p>
<pre><code>   val _ = diminish_srw_ss [“RMULCANON_ss”]</code></pre>
<p>These behaviours can also be turned off in a more fine-grained way by using <code>Excl</code> invocations.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>Induct_on</code> tactic is now more generous in the goals it will work on when inducting on an inductively defined relation. For example, if one’s goal was</p>
<pre><code>   ∀s t. FINITE (s ∪ t) ∧ s ⊆ t ⇒ some-concl</code></pre>
<p>and the aim was to do an induction using the principle associated with finite-ness’s inductive characterisation, one had to manually turn the goal into something like</p>
<pre><code>   ∀s0. FINITE s0 ==&gt; ∀s t. s0 = s ∪ t ∧ s ⊆ t ⇒ some-concl</code></pre>
<p>before applying <code>Induct_on ‘FINITE’</code>.</p>
<p>Now, <code>Induct_on</code> does the necessary transformations first itself.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>Inductive</code> and <code>CoInductive</code> syntaxes now support labelling of specific rules. The supported syntax involves names in square brackets in column 0, as per the following:</p>
<pre><code>   Inductive dbeta:
   [~redex:]
     (∀s t. dbeta (dAPP (dABS s) t) (nsub t 0 s)) ∧
   [~appL:]
     (∀s t u. dbeta s t ⇒ dbeta (dAPP s u) (dAPP t u)) ∧
   [~appR:]
     (∀s t u. dbeta s t ⇒ dbeta (dAPP u s) (dAPP u t)) ∧
   [~abs:]
     (∀s t. dbeta s t ⇒ dbeta (dABS s) (dABS t))
   End</code></pre>
<p>The use of the leading tilde (<code>~</code>) character causes the substitution of the “stem” name (here <code>dbeta</code>) and an underscore into the name. Thus in this case, there will be four theorems saved, the first of which will be called <code>dbeta_redex</code>, corresponding to the first conjunct. If there is no tilde, the name is taken exactly as given. Theorem attributes such as <code>simp</code>, <code>compute</code> <em>etc.</em> can be given in square brackets after the name and before the colon. For example, <code>[~redex[simp]:]</code>.</p>
<p>The given names are both saved into the theory (available for future users of the theory) and into the Poly/ML REPL.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a new <code>using</code> infix available in the tactic language. It is an SML function of type <code>tactic * thm -&gt; tactic</code>, and allows user-specification of theorems to use instead of the defaults. Currently, it works with the <code>Induct_on</code>, <code>Induct</code>, <code>Cases_on</code> and <code>Cases</code> tactics. All of these tactics consult global information in order to apply specific induction and cases theorems. If the <code>using</code> infix is used, they will attempt to use the provided theorem instead.</p>
<p>Thus one can do a “backwards” list induction by writing</p>
<pre><code>   Induct_on ‘mylist’ using listTheory.SNOC_INDUCT</code></pre>
<p>The <code>using</code> infix has tighter precedence than the various <code>THEN</code> operators so no extra parentheses are required.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bugs-fixed">Bugs fixed:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In <code>extrealTheory</code>: the old definition of <code>extreal_add</code> wrongly allowed <code>PosInf + NegInf = PosInf</code>, while the definition of <code>extreal_sub</code> wrongly allowed <code>PosInf - PosInf = PosInf</code> and <code>NegInf - NegInf = PosInf</code>. Now these cases are unspecified, as is division-by-zero (which is indeed allowed for reals in <code>realTheory</code>). As a consequence, now all <code>EXTREAL_SUM_IAMGE</code>- related theorems require that there must be no mixing of <code>PosInf</code> and <code>NegInf</code> in the sum elements. A bug in <code>ext_suminf</code> with non-positive functions is also fixed.</p>
<p>There is a minor backwards-incompatibility: the above changes may lead to more complicated proofs when using extreals, while better alignment with textbook proofs is achieved, on the other hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix soundness bug in the HolyHammer translations to first-order. Lambda-lifting definitions were stated as local hypothesis but were printed in the TPTP format as global definitions. In a few cases, the global definition captured some type variables causing a soundness issue. Now, local hypothesis are printed locally under the quantification of type variables in the translated formula.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-theories">New theories:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Univariate differential and integral calculus (based on Henstock-Kurzweil Integral, or gauge integral) in <code>derivativeTheory</code> and <code>integrationTheory</code>. Ported by Muhammad Qasim and Osman Hasan from HOL Light (up to 2015).</p></li>
<li><p>Measure and probability theories based on extended real numbers, <em>i.e.</em>, the type of measure (probability) is <code>α set -&gt; extreal</code>. The following new (or updated) theories are provided:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>sigma_algebraTheory</code></dt>
<dd><p>Sigma-algebra and other system of sets</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>measureTheory</code></dt>
<dd><p>Measure Theory defined on extended reals</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>real_borelTheory</code></dt>
<dd><p>Borel-measurable sets generated from reals</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>borelTheory</code></dt>
<dd><p>Borel sets (on extended reals) and Borel-measurable functions</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>lebesgueTheory</code></dt>
<dd><p>Lebesgue integration theory</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>martingaleTheory</code></dt>
<dd><p>Martingales based on sigma-finite filtered measure space</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>probabilityTheory</code></dt>
<dd><p>Probability theory based on extended reals</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Notable theorems include: Carathéodory's Extension Theorem (for semirings), the construction of 1-dimensional Borel and Lebesgue measure spaces, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Tonelli and Fubini's theorems (product measures), Bayes' Rule (Conditional Probability), Kolmogorov 0-1 Law, Borel-Cantelli Lemma, Markov/Chebyshev's inequalities, convergence concepts of random sequences, and simple versions of the Law(s) of Large Numbers.</p>
<p>There is a major backwards-incompatibility: old proof scripts based on real-valued measure and probability theories should now open the following legacy theories instead: <code>sigma_algebraTheory</code>, <code>real_measureTheory</code>, <code>real_borelTheory</code>, <code>real_lebesgueTheory</code> and <code>real_probabilityTheory</code>. These legacy theories are stil maintained to support <code>examples/miller</code> and <code>examples/diningcryptos</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Thanks to Muhammad Qasim, Osman Hasan, Liya Liu and Waqar Ahmad <em>et al.</em> for the original work, and Chun Tian for the integration and further extension.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-tools">New tools:</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>holwrap.py</code>: a simple python script that ‘wraps’ hol in a similar fashion to <code>rlwrap</code>. Features include multiline input, history and basic StandardML syntax highlighting. See the comments at the head of the script for usage instructions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-examples">New examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>algebra</strong>: an abstract algebra library for HOL4. The algebraic types are generic, so the library is useful in general. The algebraic structures consist of <code>monoidTheory</code> for monoids with identity, <code>groupTheory</code> for groups, <code>ringTheory</code> for commutative rings, <code>fieldTheory</code> for fields, <code>polynomialTheory</code> for polynomials with coefficients from rings or fields, <code>linearTheory</code> for vector spaces, including linear independence, and <code>finitefieldTheory</code> for finite fields, including existence and uniqueness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>simple_complexity</strong>: a simple theory of recurrence loops to assist the computational complexity analysis of algorithms. The ingredients are <code>bitsizeTheory</code> for the complexity measure using binary bits, <code>complexityTheory</code> for the big-O complexity class, and <code>loopTheory</code> for various recurrence loop patterns of iteration steps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AKS</strong>: a mechanisation of the AKS algorithm, contributed by Hing Lun Chan from his PhD work.</p>
<p>The theory behind the AKS algorithm is delivered in <strong>AKS/theories</strong>, starting with <code>AKSintroTheory</code>, the introspective relation, culminating in <code>AKSimprovedTheory</code>, proving that the AKS algorithm is a primality test. The underlying theories are based on finite fields, hence making use of <code>finitefieldTheory</code> in <strong>algebra</strong>.</p>
<p>An implementation of the AKS algorithm is shown to execute in polynomial-time: the pseudo-code of subroutines is given in <strong>AKS/compute</strong>, and the corresponding implementations in monadic style are given in <strong>AKS/machine</strong>, which includes a simple machine model outlined in <code>countMonadTheory</code> and <code>countMacroTheory</code>. Run-time analysis of subroutines is based on <code>loopTheory</code> in <strong>simple_complexity</strong>.</p>
<p>The AKS main theorems and proofs have been cleaned up in <code>AKScleanTheory</code>. For details, please refer to his <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1885/177195">PhD thesis</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The code for training tree neural networks using <code>mlTreeNeuralNetwork</code> on datasets of arithmetical and propositional formulas is located in <strong>AI_TNN</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>A demonstration of the reinforcement learning algorithm <code>mlReinforce</code> on the tasks of synthesizing combinators and Diophantine equations can be found in <strong>AI_tasks</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>bootstrap</strong>: a minimalistic verified bootstrapped compiler. By bootstrapped, we mean that the compiler is applied to itself inside the logic. We evaluate (using EVAL) this self-application to arrive at an x86-64 assembly implementation of the compiler function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hoare-for-divergence</strong>: a Hoare logic for proving properties of (the output behaviour of) diverging programs. This Hoare logic has been proved sound and complete. The same directory also includes soundness and completeness proofs for a standard total-correctness Hoare logic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lassie</strong>: a tool for developing tactic languages by example. A tutorial using Lassie is included in the manual, and more details about the technique can be found in the corresponding <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00930">paper</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="incompatibilities">Incompatibilities:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Two new rewrites to do with disjunctions have been introduced into the automatic simplifier (and also other simpsets that derive from the fundamental <code>bool_ss</code> value). The rewrites are</p>
<pre><code>   [lift_disj_eq]
     ⊢ (x ≠ y ∨ P ⇔ x = y ⇒ P) ∧
       (P ∨ x ≠ y ⇔ x = y ⇒ P)

   [lift_imp_disj]
     ⊢ ((P ⇒ Q) ∨ R ⇔ P ⇒ Q ∨ R) ∧
       (R ∨ (P ⇒ Q) ⇔ P ⇒ R ∨ Q)</code></pre>
<p>These can be removed with <code>Excl</code> directives, the <code>-*</code> operator or <code>{temp_,}delsimps</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The treatment of abbreviations (introduced with <code>qabbrev_tac</code> for example), has changed slightly. The system tries harder to prevent abbreviation assumptions from changing in form; they should stay as <code>Abbrev(v = e)</code>, with <code>v</code> a variable, for longer. Further, the tactic <code>VAR_EQ_TAC</code> which eliminates equalities in assumptions and does some other forms of cleanup, and which is called as part of the action of <code>rw</code>, <code>SRW_TAC</code> and others, now eliminates “malformed” abbreviations. To restore the old behaviours, two steps are required:</p>
<pre><code>   val _ = diminish_srw_ss [&quot;ABBREV&quot;]
   val _ = set_trace &quot;BasicProvers.var_eq_old&quot; 1</code></pre>
<p>which invocation can be made at the head of script files.</p></li>
<li><p>The theorem <code>rich_listTheory.REVERSE</code> (alias of <code>listTheory.REVERSE_SNOC_DEF</code>) has been removed because <code>REVERSE</code> is also a tactical (<code>Tactical.REVERSE</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>listTheory</code> and <code>rich_listTheory</code>: Some theorems have been generalized.</p>
<p>For example, <code>EVERY_{TAKE, DROP, BUTLASTN, LASTN}</code> had unnecessary preconditions. As a result of some theorems being generalized, some <code>_IMP</code> versions of the same theorems have been dropped, as they are now special cases of the non-<code>_IMP</code> versions.</p>
<p>Also, <code>DROP_NIL</code> has been renamed to <code>DROP_EQ_NIL</code>, to avoid having both <code>DROP_nil</code> and <code>DROP_NIL</code> around. Furthermore, <code>&gt;=</code> in the theorem statement has been replaced with <code>&lt;=</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Renamed theorems in <code>pred_setTheory</code>: <code>SUBSET_SUBSET_EQ</code> became <code>SUBSET_ANTISYM_EQ</code> (compatible with HOL Light).</p></li>
<li><p>The theorem <code>SORTED_APPEND_trans_IFF</code> has been moved from <code>alist_treeTheory</code> into <code>sortingTheory</code>. The moved theorem is now available as <code>SORTED_APPEND</code>, and the old <code>SORTED_APPEND</code> is now available as <code>SORTED_APPEND_IMP</code>. To avoid confusion, as <code>SORTED_APPEND</code> is now an (conditional) equality, <code>SORTED_APPEND_IFF</code> has been renamed to <code>SORTED_APPEND_GEN</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The definition <code>SORTED_DEF</code> is now an automatic rewrite, meaning that terms of the form <code>SORTED R (h1::h2::t)</code> will now rewrite to <code>R h1 h2 /\ SORTED (h2::t)</code> (in addition to the existing automatic rewrites for <code>SORTED R []</code> and <code>SORTED R [x]</code>). To restore the old behaviour it is necessary to exclude <code>SORTED_DEF</code> (use <code>temp_delsimps</code>), and reinstate <code>SORTED_NIL</code> and <code>SORTED_SING</code> (use <code>augment_srw_ss [rewrites [thmnames]]</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>The syntax for <em>greater than</em> in <code>intSyntax</code> and <code>realSyntax</code> is consistently named as in <code>numSyntax</code>: The functions <code>great_tm</code>,<code>dest_great</code> and <code>mk_great</code> become <code>greater_tm</code>, <code>dest_greater</code> and <code>mk_greater</code>, respectively. Additionally, <code>int_arithTheory.add_to_great</code> is renamed to <code>int_arithTheory.add_to_greater</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Two theorems about <code>list$nub</code> (the constant that removes duplicates in a list), have been made automatic: <code>listTheory.nub_NIL</code> (<code>⊢ nub [] = []</code>) and <code>listTheory.all_distinct_nub</code> (<code>⊢ ∀l. ALL_DISTINCT (nub l)</code>). Calls to <code>temp_delsimps</code> can be used to remove automatic rewrites as necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>The SML API for <code>ThmSetData</code> has changed; user-provided call-backs that apply set-changes (additions and removals of theorems) are only ever called with single changes at once rather than lists, so the required types for these call-backs has changed to reflect this.</p></li>
<li><p>Parsing of <code>~x</code> has been changed so that this is always preferentially interpreted as being a boolean operation. This may break proofs over types with a numeric negation that use expressions such as</p>
<pre><code>   SPEC “~x” some_theorem</code></pre>
<p>It is much better style to use <code>Q.SPEC ‘~x’ some_theorem</code>; and indeed one can also use <code>-</code> as a unary operator, so that <code>Q.SPEC ‘-x’ some_theorem</code> will also work.</p>
<p>If a big script is broken by this, one can reinstate the old behaviour by changing the grammar locally with</p>
<pre><code>   Overload &quot;~&quot;[local] = “numeric_negation_operator”</code></pre>
<p>where the appropriate negation operator might be, <em>e.g.</em>, <code>“$real_neg”</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Two theorems about <code>TAKE</code> and <code>DROP</code> have been added to the stateful simplifier:</p>
<pre><code>   TAKE_LENGTH_ID_rwt2
   ⊢ ∀l m. TAKE m l = l ⇔ LENGTH l ≤ m

   DROP_EQ_NIL
   ⊢ ∀l m. DROP m l = [] ⇔ LENGTH l ≤ m</code></pre>
<p>The former is a new theorem; the latter is an existing theorem that has been promoted to “automatic” status. Use <code>Excl</code> or <code>{temp_,}delsimps</code> to remove these theorems from the simplifier as necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>BIGINTER_SUBSET</code> theorem in <code>pred_setTheory</code> has changed from</p>
<pre><code>   ⊢ ∀sp s. (∀t. t ∈ s ⇒ t ⊆ sp) ∧ s ≠ ∅ ⇒ BIGINTER s ⊆ sp</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>   ⊢ ∀sp s t. t ∈ s ∧ t ⊆ sp ⇒ BIGINTER s ⊆ sp</code></pre></li>
